In this practical, example-driven book, one of the world’s most experienced Linux driver developers systematically demonstrates how to develop reliable Linux drivers for virtually any device. Essential Linux Device Drivers is for any programmer with a working knowledge of operating systems and C, including programmers who have never written drivers before. Sreekrishnan Venkateswaran focuses on the essentials, bringing together all the concepts and techniques you need, while avoiding topics that only matter in highly specialized situations. Venkateswaran begins by reviewing the Linux 2.6 kernel capabilities that are most relevant to driver developers. He introduces simple device classes; then turns to serial buses such as I2C and SPI; external buses such as PCMCIA, PCI, and USB; video, audio, block, network, and wireless device drivers; user-space drivers; and drivers for embedded Linux–one of today’s fastest growing areas of Linux development. For each, Venkateswaran explains the technology, inspects relevant kernel source files, and walks through developing a complete example. • Addresses drivers discussed in no other book, including drivers for I2C, video, sound, PCMCIA, and different types of flash memory • Demystifies essential kernel services and facilities, including kernel threads and helper interfaces • Teaches polling, asynchronous notification, and I/O control • Introduces the Inter-Integrated Circuit Protocol for embedded Linux drivers • Covers multimedia device drivers using the Linux-Video subsystem and Linux-Audio framework • Shows how Linux implements support for wireless technologies such as Bluetooth, Infrared, WiFi, and cellular networking • Describes the entire driver development lifecycle, through debugging and maintenance • Includes reference appendixes covering Linux assembly, BIOS calls, and Seq files', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Boo57V0IOq0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2008-03-27', false);

ACE frameworks handle common network programming tasks and can be customized using C++ language features to produce complete distributed applications. C++ Network Programming, Volume 2, focuses on ACE frameworks, providing thorough coverage of the concepts, patterns, and usage rules that form their structure. This book is a practical guide to designing object-oriented frameworks and shows developers how to apply frameworks to concurrent networked applications. C++ Networking, Volume 1, introduced ACE and the wrapper facades, which are basic network computing ingredients. Volume 2 explains how frameworks build on wrapper facades to provide higher-level communication services. Written by two experts in the ACE community, this book contains: An overview of ACE frameworks Design dimensions for networked services Descriptions of the key capabilities of the most important ACE frameworks Numerous C++ code examples that demonstrate how to use ACE frameworks C++ Network Programming, Volume 2, teaches how to use frameworks to write networked applications quickly, reducing development effort and overhead. It will be an invaluable asset to any C++ developer working on networked applications.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u1mKwaIbLwsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2002-10-29', false);

A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship', 'Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer–but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code–lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code–of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understanding How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2008-08-01', false);

The key, as the authors show, is to integrate regularly and often using continuous integration (CI) practices and techniques. The authors first examine the concept of CI and its practices from the ground up and then move on to explore other effective processes performed by CI systems, such as database integration, testing, inspection, deployment, and feedback. Through more than forty CI-related practices using application examples in different languages, readers learn that CI leads to more rapid software development, produces deployable software at every step in the development lifecycle, and reduces the time between defect introduction and detection, saving time and lowering costs. With successful implementation of CI, developers reduce risks and repetitive manual processes, and teams receive better project visibility.

I remember mine. It was a little graphics program I wrote on an early PC. I started programming later than most of my friends. Sure, I''d seen computers when I was a kid. I remember being really impressed by a minicomputer I once saw in an office, but for years I never had a chance to even sit at a computer. Later, when I was a teenager, some friends of mine bought a couple of the first TRS-80s. I was interested, but I was actually a bit apprehensive, too. I knew that if I started to play with computers, I''d get sucked into it. It just looked too cool. I don''t know why I knew myself so well, but I held back. Later, in college, a roommate of mine had a computer, and I bought a C compiler so that I could teach myself programming. Then it began. I stayed up night after night trying things out, poring through the source code of the emacs editor that came with the compiler. It was addictive, it was challenging, and I loved it. I hope you''ve had experiences like thismdjust the raw joy of making things work on a computer. Nearly every programmer I ask has. That joy is part of what got us into this work, but where is it day to day? A few years ago, I gave my friend Erik Meade a call after I''d finished work one night. I knew that Erik had just started a consulting gig with a new team, so I asked him, "How are they doing?" He said, "They''re writing legacy code, man." That was one of the few times in my life when I was sucker-punched by a coworker''s statement. I felt it right in my gut. Erik had given words to the precise feeling that I often get when I visit teams for the first time. They are trying very hard, but at the end of the day, because of schedule pressure, the weight of history, or a lack of any better code to compare their efforts to, many people are writing legacy code. What is legacy code? I''ve used the term without defining it. Let''s look at the strict definition: Legacy code is code that we''ve gotten from someone else. Maybe our company acquired code from another company; maybe people on the original team moved on to other projects. Legacy code is somebody else''s code. But in programmer-speak, the term means much more than that. The termlegacy codehas taken on more shades of meaning and more weight over time. What do you think about when you hear the termlegacy code? If you are at all like me, you think of tangled, unintelligible structure, code that you have to change but don''t really understand. You think of sleepless nights trying to add in features that should be easy to add, and you think of demoralization, the sense that everyone on the team is so sick of a code base that it seems beyond care, the sort of code that you just wish would die. Part of you feels bad for even thinking about making it better. It seems unworthy of your efforts. That definition of legacy code has nothing to do with who wrote it. Code can degrade in many ways, and many of them have nothing to do with whether the code came from another team. In the industry,legacy codeis often used as a slang term for difficult-to-change code that we don''t understand. But over years of working with teams, helping them get past serious code problems, I''ve arrived at a different definition. To me,legacy codeis simply code without tests. I''ve gotten some grief for this definition. What do tests have to do with whether code is bad? To me, the answer is straightforward, and it is a point that I elaborate throughout the book: Code without tests is bad code. It doesn''t matter how well written it is; it doesn''t matter how pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated it is. With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don''t know if our code is getting better or worse. You might think that this is severe. What about clean code? If a code base is very clean and well structured, isn''t that enough? Well, make no mistake. I love clean code. I love it more than most people I know, but while clean code is good, it''s not enough. Teams take serious chances when they try to make large changes without tests. It is like doing aerial gymnastics without a net. It requires incredible skill and a clear understanding of what can happen at every step. Knowing precisely what will happen if you change a couple of variables is often like knowing whether another gymnast is going to catch your arms after you come out of a somersault. If you are on a team with code that clear, you are in a better position than most programmers. In my work, I''ve noticed that teams with that degree of clarity in all of their code are rare. They seem like a statistical anomaly. And, you know what? If they don''t have supporting tests, their code changes still appear to be slower than those of teams that do. Yes, teams do get better and start to write clearer code, but it takes a long time for older code to get clearer. In many cases, it will never happen completely. Because of this, I have no problem defining legacy code as code without tests. It is a good working definition, and it points to a solution. I''ve been talking about tests quite a bit so far, but this book is not about testing. This book is about being able to confidently make changes in any code base. In the following chapters, I describe techniques that you can use to understand code, get it under test, refactor it, and add features. One thing that you will notice as you read this book is that it is not a book about pretty code. The examples that I use in the book are fabricated because I work under nondisclosure agreements with clients. But in many of the examples, I''ve tried to preserve the spirit of code that I''ve seen in the field. I won''t say that the examples are always representative. There certainly are oases of great code out there, but, frankly, there are also pieces of code that are far worse than anything I can use as an example in this book. Aside from client confidentiality, I simply couldn''t put code like that in this book without boring you to tears and burying important points in a morass of detail. As a result, many of the examples are relatively brief. If you look at one of them and think "No, he doesn''t understandmdmy methods are much larger than that and much worse," please look at the advice that I am giving at face value and see if it applies, even if the example seems simpler. The techniques here have been tested on substantially large pieces of code. It is just a limitation of the book format that makes examples smaller. In particular, when you see ellipses (el) in a code fragment like this, you can read them as "insert 500 lines of ugly code here": m_pDispatcher->register(listener);...m_nMargins++; If this book is not about pretty code, it is even less about pretty design. Good design should be a goal for all of us, but in legacy code, it is something that we arrive at in discrete steps. In some of the chapters, I describe ways of adding new code to existing code bases and show how to add it with good design principles in mind. You can start to grow areas of very good high-quality code in legacy code bases, but don''t be surprised if some of the steps you take to make changes involve making some code slightly uglier. This work is like surgery. We have to make incisions, and we have to move through the guts and suspend some aesthetic judgment. Could this patient''s major organs and viscera be better than they are? Yes. So do we just forget about his immediate problem, sew him up again, and tell him to eat right and train for a marathon? We could, but what we really need to do is take the patient as he is, fix what''s wrong, and move him to a healthier state. He might never become an Olympic athlete, but we can''t let "best" be the enemy of "better." Code bases can become healthier and easier to work in. When a patient feels a little better, often that is the time when you can help him make commitments to a healthier life style. That is what we are shooting for with legacy code. We are trying to get to the point at which we are used to ease; we expect it and actively attempt to make code change easier. When we can sustain that sense on a team, design gets better. The techniques I describe are ones that I''ve discovered and learned with coworkers and clients over the course of years working with clients to try to establish control over unruly code bases. I got into this legacy code emphasis accidentally. When I first started working with Object Mentor, the bulk of my work involved helping teams with serious problems develop their skills and interactions to the point that they could regularly deliver quality code. We often used Extreme Programming practices to help teams take control of their work, collaborate intensively, and deliver. I often feel that Extreme Programming is less a way to develop software than it is a way to make a well-jelled work team that just happens to deliver great software every two weeks. From the beginning, though, there was a problem. Many of the first XP projects were "greenfield" projects. The clients I was seeing had significantly large code bases, and they were in trouble. They needed some way to get control of their work and start to deliver. Over time, I found that I was doing the same things over and over again with clients. This sense culminated in some work I was doing with a team in the financial industry. Before I''d arrived, they''d realized that unit testing was a great thing, but the tests that they were executing were full scenario tests that made multiple trips to a database and exercised large chunks of code. The tests were hard to write, and the team didn''t run them very often because they took so long to run. As I sat down with them to break dependencies and get smaller chunks of code under test, I had a terrible sense of deasjaag vu. It seemed that I was doing this sort of work with every team I met, and it was the sort of thing that no one really wanted to think about. It was just the grunge work that you do when you want to start working with your code in a controlled way, if you know how to do it. I decided then that it was worth really reflecting on how we were solving these problems and writing them down so that teams could get a leg up and start to make their code bases easier to live in. A note about the examples: I''ve used examples in several different programming languages. The bulk of the examples are written in Java, C++, and C. I picked Java because it is a very common language, and I included C++ because it presents some special challenges in a legacy environment. I picked C because it highlights many of the problems that come up in procedural legacy code. Among them, these languages cover much of the spectrum of concerns that arise in legacy code. However, if the languages you using are not covered in the examples, take a look at them anyway. Many of the techniques that I cover can be used in other languages, such as Delphi, Visual Basic, COBOL, and FORTRAN. I hope that you find the techniques in this book helpful and that they allow you to get back to what is fun about programming. Programming can be very rewarding and enjoyable work. If you don''t feel that in your day-to-day work, I hope that the techniques I offer you in this book help you find it and grow it on your team. Acknowledgements First of all, I owe a serious debt to my wife, Ann, and my children, Deborah and Ryan. Their love and support made this book and all of the learning that preceded it possible. I''d also like to thank "Uncle Bob" Martin, president and founder of Object Mentor. His rigorous pragmatic approach to development and design, separating the critical from the inconsequential, gave me something to latch upon about 10 years ago, back when it seemed that I was about to drown in a wave of unrealistic advice. And thanks, Bob, for giving me the opportunity to see more code and work with more people over the past five years than I ever imagined possible. I also have to thank Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries, and Ward Cunningham for offering me advice at times and teaching me a great deal about team work, design, and programming. Special thanks to all of the people who reviewed the drafts. The official reviewers were Sven Gorts, Robert C. Martin, Erik Meade, and Bill Wake; the unofficial reviewers were Dr. Robert Koss, James Grenning, Lowell Lindstrom, Micah Martin, Russ Rufer and the Silicon Valley Patterns Group, and James Newkirk. Thanks also to reviewers of the very early drafts I placed on the Internet. Their feedback significantly affected the direction of the book after I reorganized its format. I apologize in advance to any of you I may have left out. The early reviewers were: Darren Hobbs, Martin Lippert, Keith Nicholas, Phlip Plumlee, C. Keith Ray, Robert Blum, Bill Burris, William Caputo, Brian Marick, Steve Freeman, David Putman, Emily Bache, Dave Astels, Russel Hill, Christian Sepulveda, and Brian Christopher Robinson. Thanks also to Joshua Kerievsky who gave a key early review and Jeff Langr who helped with advice and spot reviews all through the process.

As multicore processors become the norm, using concurrency effectively becomes essential for building high-performance applications. Java SE 5 and 6 are a huge step forward for the development of concurrent applications, with improvements to the Java Virtual Machine to support high-performance, highly scalable concurrent classes and a rich set of new concurrency building blocks. In Java Concurrency in Practice , the creators of these new facilities explain not only how they work and how to use them, but also the motivation and design patterns behind them. However, developing, testing, and debugging multithreaded programs can still be very difficult; it is all too easy to create concurrent programs that appear to work, but fail when it matters most: in production, under heavy load. Java Concurrency in Practice arms readers with both the theoretical underpinnings and concrete techniques for building reliable, scalable, maintainable concurrent applications. Rather than simply offering an inventory of concurrency APIs and mechanisms, it provides design rules, patterns, and mental models that make it easier to build concurrent programs that are both correct and performant.

The book helps you to continue to grow and clearly comes from people who have been there.” —Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change “I found this book to be a great mix of solid advice and wonderful analogies!” —Martin Fowler, author of Refactoring and UML Distilled “I would buy a copy, read it twice, then tell all my colleagues to run out and grab a copy. This is a book I would never loan because I would worry about it being lost.” —Kevin Ruland, Management Science, MSG-Logistics “The wisdom and practical experience of the authors is obvious. The topics presented are relevant and useful.... By far its greatest strength for me has been the outstanding analogies—tracer bullets, broken windows, and the fabulous helicopter-based explanation of the need for orthogonality, especially in a crisis situation. I have little doubt that this book will eventually become an excellent source of useful information for journeymen programmers and expert mentors alike.” —John Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design “This is the sort of book I will buy a dozen copies of when it comes out so I can give it to my clients.” —Eric Vought, Software Engineer “Most modern books on software development fail to cover the basics of what makes a great software developer, instead spending their time on syntax or technology where in reality the greatest leverage possible for any software team is in having talented developers who really know their craft well. An excellent book.” —Pete McBreen, Independent Consultant “Since reading this book, I have implemented many of the practical suggestions and tips it contains. Across the board, they have saved my company time and money while helping me get my job done quicker! This should be a desktop reference for everyone who works with code for a living.” —Jared Richardson, Senior Software Developer, iRenaissance, Inc. “I would like to see this issued to every new employee at my company....” —Chris Cleeland, Senior Software Engineer, Object Computing, Inc. “If I’m putting together a project, it’s the authors of this book that I want. . . . And failing that I’d settle for people who’ve read their book.” —Ward Cunningham Straight from the programming trenches, The Pragmatic Programmer cuts through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core process--taking a requirement and producing working, maintainable code that delights its users. It covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. Read this book, and you''ll learn how to Fight software rot; Avoid the trap of duplicating knowledge; Write flexible, dynamic, and adaptable code; Avoid programming by coincidence; Bullet-proof your code with contracts, assertions, and exceptions; Capture real requirements; Test ruthlessly and effectively; Delight your users; Build teams of pragmatic programmers; and Make your developments more precise with automation. Written as a series of self-contained sections and filled with entertaining anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, The Pragmatic Programmer illustrates the best practices and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. Whether you''re a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you''ll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction. You''ll learn skills and develop habits and attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in your career.

This software is ubiquitous, hidden away inside our watches, DVD players, mobile phones, anti-lock brakes, and even a few toasters. The military uses embedded software to guide missiles, detect enemy aircraft, and pilot UAVs. Communication satellites, deep-space probes, and many medical instruments would have been nearly impossible to create without embedded software. The first edition of Programming Embedded Systems taught the subject to tens of thousands ofpeople around the world and is now considered the bible of embedded programming. This second edition has been updated to cover all the latest hardware designs and development methodologies. The techniques and code examples presented here are directly applicable to real-world embedded software projects of all sorts. Examples use the free GNU software programming tools, the eCos and Linux operating systems, and a low-cost hardware platform specially developed for this book. If you obtain these tools along withProgramming Embedded Systems, Second Edition, you''ll have a full environment for exploring embedded systems in depth. But even if you work with different hardware and software, the principles covered in this bookapply. Whether you are new to embedded systems or have done embedded work before, you''ll benefit from the topics in this book, which include: How building and loading programs differ from desktop or servercomputers Basic debugging techniques--a critical skill when working withminimally endowed embedded systems Handling different types of memory Interrupts, and the monitoring and control of on-chip and externalperipherals Determining whether you have real-time requirements, and whetheryour operating system and application can meet those requirements Task synchronization with real-time operating systems and embeddedLinux Optimizing embedded software for size, speed, and power consumption Working examples for eCos and embedded Linux So whether you''re writing your first embedded program, designing thelatest generation of hand-held whatchamacalits, or managing the peoplewho do, this book is for you.

While corpus-based analysis has had relatively little influence on theoretical linguistics, it has revolutionized the study of language variation and use: what speakers and writers actually do with the lexical and grammatical resources of a language. Corpus-based research employs the research methods of quantitative and qualitative social science to investigate language use patterns empirically. This four-volume collection is organized around linguistic research questions that can be investigated from a corpus perspective and includes amongst others studies of individual words, comparisons of supposedly synonymous words, studies of grammatical variation, and sociolinguistic studies of dialects, registers, styles, and world varieties.

In 1999, Refactoring revolutionized design by introducing an effective process for improving code. With the highly anticipated Refactoring to Patterns , Joshua Kerievsky has changed our approach to design by forever uniting patterns with the evolutionary process of refactoring. This book introduces the theory and practice of pattern-directed refactorings: sequences of low-level refactorings that allow designers to safely move designs to, towards, or away from pattern implementations. Using code from real-world projects, Kerievsky documents the thinking and steps underlying over two dozen pattern-based design transformations. Along the way he offers insights into pattern differences and how to implement patterns in the simplest possible ways. Coverage includes: A catalog of twenty-seven pattern-directed refactorings, featuring real-world code examples Descriptions of twelve design smells that indicate the need for this book’s refactorings General information and new insights about patterns and refactoring Detailed implementation mechanics: how low-level refactorings are combined to implement high-level patterns Multiple ways to implement the same pattern–and when to use each Practical ways to get started even if you have little experience with patterns or refactoring Refactoring to Patterns reflects three years of refinement and the insights of more than sixty software engineering thought leaders in the global patterns, refactoring, and agile development communities.

Design Patterns Explained, Second Edition is the field''s simplest, clearest, most practical introduction to patterns. Using dozens of updated Java examples, it shows programmers and architects exactly how to use patterns to design, develop, and deliver software far more effectively. You''ll start with a complete overview of the fundamental principles of patterns, and the role of object-oriented analysis and design in contemporary software development. Then, using easy-to-understand sample code, Alan Shalloway and James Trott illuminate dozens of today''s most useful patterns: their underlying concepts, advantages, tradeoffs, implementation techniques, and pitfalls to avoid. Many patterns are accompanied by UML diagrams. Building on their best-selling First Edition, Shalloway and Trott have thoroughly updated this book to reflect new software design trends, patterns, and implementation techniques. Reflecting extensive reader feedback, they have deepened and clarified coverage throughout, and reorganized content for even greater ease of understanding.

Increasing processing power has allowed for the creation of much more sophisticated software tools for the analysis and debugging of programs.

Why Programs Fail is about bugs in computer programs, how to reproduce them, how to find them, and how to fix them in such a way that they do not occur anymore. This is the first comprehensive book on systematic debugging and covers a wide range of tools and techniques ranging from hands-on observation to fully automated diagnoses, and includes instructions for building automated debuggers.

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous "Object Not Found" alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail. These challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers.

Rather, it is about applying a concise set of guiding principles to each unique group situation—and doing so in the leader''s own idiosyncratic way. Based on extensive research and using compelling examples ranging from orchestras to airline cockpit crews, Leading Teams identifies five essential conditions—a stable team, a clear and engaging direction, an enabling team structure, a supportive organizational context, and the availability of competent coaching—that greatly enhance the likelihood of team success. The book offers a practical framework that leaders can use to muster personal skills and organizational resources to create and sustain the five key conditions and shows how those conditions can launch a team onto a trajectory of increasing effectiveness.

Paradise, vice president, engineering, threat response, intelligence, and development, Cisco Systems Secure programming in C can be more difficult than even many experienced programmers realize. To help programmers write more secure code, The CERT® C Coding Standard, Second Edition, fully documents the second official release of the CERT standard for secure coding in C. The rules laid forth in this new edition will help ensure that programmers’ code fully complies with the new C11 standard; it also addresses earlier versions, including C99. The new standard itemizes those coding errors that are the root causes of current software vulnerabilities in C, prioritizing them by severity, likelihood of exploitation, and remediation costs. Each of the text’s 98 guidelines includes examples of insecure code as well as secure, C11-conforming, alternative implementations. If uniformly applied, these guidelines will eliminate critical coding errors that lead to buffer overflows, format-string vulnerabilities, integer overflow, and other common vulnerabilities. This book reflects numerous experts’ contributions to the open development and review of the rules and recommendations that comprise this standard.

Add Effective STL to that list.” – Thomas Becker, Senior Software Engineer, Zephyr Associates, Inc., and columnist, C/C++ Users Journal C++’s Standard Template Library is revolutionary, but learning to use it well has always been a challenge. Until now. In this book, best-selling author Scott Meyers ( Effective C++ , and More Effective C++ ) reveals the critical rules of thumb employed by the experts – the things they almost always do or almost always avoid doing – to get the most out of the library. Other books describe what’s in the STL. Effective STL shows you how to use it. Each of the book’s 50 guidelines is backed by Meyers’ legendary analysis and incisive examples, so you’ll learn not only what to do, but also when to do it – and why. Highlights of Effective STL include: Advice on choosing among standard STL containers (like vector and list), nonstandard STL containers (like hash_set and hash_map), and non-STL containers (like bitset). Techniques to maximize the efficiency of the STL and the programs that use it. Insights into the behavior of iterators, function objects, and allocators, including things you should not do. Guidance for the proper use of algorithms and member functions whose names are the same (e.g., find), but whose actions differ in subtle (but important) ways. Discussions of potential portability problems, including straightforward ways to avoid them. Like Meyers’ previous books, Effective STL is filled with proven wisdom that comes only from experience. Its clear, concise, penetrating style makes it an essential resource for every STL programmer.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RPnWe6QKnCcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2001-06-06', false);

In this illuminating series of case studies, Scrum co-creator and evangelist Ken Schwaber identifies the real-world lessons—the successes and failures—culled from his years of experience coaching companies in agile project management. Through them, you’ll understand how to use Scrum to solve complex problems and drive better results—delivering more valuable software faster. Gain the foundation in Scrum theory—and practice—you need to: Rein in even the most complex, unwieldy projects Effectively manage unknown or changing product requirements Simplify the chain of command with self-managing development teams Receive clearer specifications—and feedback—from customers Greatly reduce project planning time and required tools Build—and release—products in 30-day cycles so clients get deliverables earlier Avoid missteps by regularly inspecting, reporting on, and fine-tuning projects Support multiple teams working on a large-scale project from many geographic locations Maximize return on investment!', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6pZCAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2004-02-11', false);

Fully updated for the newest innovations, it demonstrates each protocol in action through realistic examples from modern Linux, Windows, and Mac OS environments. There’s no better way to discover why TCP/IP works as it does, how it reacts to common conditions, and how to apply it in your own applications and networks. Building on the late W. Richard Stevens’ classic first edition, author Kevin R. Fall adds his cutting-edge experience as a leader in TCP/IP protocol research, updating the book to fully reflect the latest protocols and best practices. He first introduces TCP/IP’s core goals and architectural concepts, showing how they can robustly connect diverse networks and support multiple services running concurrently. Next, he carefully explains Internet addressing in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Then, he walks through TCP/IP’s structure and function from the bottom up: from link layer protocols–such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi–through network, transport, and application layers. Fall thoroughly introduces ARP, DHCP, NAT, firewalls, ICMPv4/ICMPv6, broadcasting, multicasting, UDP, DNS, and much more. He offers extensive coverage of reliable transport and TCP, including connection management, timeout, retransmission, interactive data flow, and congestion control. Finally, he introduces the basics of security and cryptography, and illuminates the crucial modern protocols for protecting security and privacy, including EAP, IPsec, TLS, DNSSEC, and DKIM. Whatever your TCP/IP experience, this book will help you gain a deeper, more intuitive understanding of the entire protocol suite so you can build better applications and run more reliable, efficient networks.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a23OAn5i8R0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2011-11-08', false);

Follow someone if you can, but if you''re on your own-better get the map! AntiPatterns is the map. This book helps you navigate through today''s dangerous software development projects. Just look at the statistics: * Nearly one-third of all software projects are cancelled. * Two-thirds of all software projects encounter cost overruns in excess of 200%. * Over 80% of all software projects are deemed failures. While patterns help you to identify and implement procedures, designs, and codes that work, AntiPatterns do the exact opposite; they let you zero-in on the development detonators, architectural tripwires, and personality booby traps that can spell doom for your project. Written by an all-star team of object-oriented systems developers, AntiPatterns identifies 40 of the most common AntiPatterns in the areas of software development, architecture, and project management. The authors then show you how to detect and defuse AntiPatterns as well as supply refactored solutions for each AntiPattern presented.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dp9QAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', '1998-04-03', false);

In fact, embedded systems are one of the most rapidly growing segments of the computer industry today.Along with the growing list of devices for which embedded computer systems are appropriate, interest is growing among programmers, hobbyists, and engineers of all types in how to design and build devices of their own. Furthermore, the knowledge offered by this book into the fundamentals of these computer systems can benefit anyone who has to evaluate and apply the systems.The second edition of Designing Embedded Hardware has been updated to include information on the latest generation of processors and microcontrollers, including the new MAXQ processor. If you''re new to this and don''t know what a MAXQ is, don''t worry--the book spells out the basics of embedded design for beginners while providing material useful for advanced systems designers.Designing Embedded Hardware steers a course between those books dedicated to writing code for particular microprocessors, and those that stress the philosophy of embedded system design without providing any practical information. Having designed 40 embedded computer systems of his own, author John Catsoulis brings a wealth of real-world experience to show readers how to design and create entirely new embedded devices and computerized gadgets, as well as how to customize and extend off-the-shelf systems.Loaded with real examples, this book also provides a roadmap to the pitfalls and traps to avoid.

A tutrial and Reference', '"TR1 roughly doubles the size of the C++ standard library, and it introduces many new facilities and even new kinds of library components. TR1 has some classes, for example, where some nested types may or may not exist depending on the template arguments. To programmers whose experience stops with the standard library, this is strange and unfamiliar. This book is complete (it covers all TR1 facilities), it is easier to understand than TR1 itself, and it is technically accurate." --Matthew Austern,software engineer, Google "TR1 will help make the C++ programmer more productive than ever. In this book, Pete Becker has written the ultimate reference guide to these components, what they are, how they work, and what they''re used for. This book should be on the bookshelf of anyone who wants to use these standardized components to improve both their productivity as well as their coding quality." --John Maddock, consultant and programmer The current C++ standard library extends the core C++ language with common classes and functions. In recent years, to address limitations in that library, a number of components have been developed to extend the language even further. Compiled in a comprehensive technical report (TR1), the bulk of these extensions have been approved for the next revision of the C++ standard. In this book, Pete Becker describes in detail each component in the TR1 library, explaining new facilities for utilities, containers, call wrappers, type traits, numerics, regular expressions, and C compatibility. He draws on his own experience implementing these components to illustrate their value, clarifying the specifications when necessary and providing complete, tested code examples. Most chapters include exercises of various degrees of difficulty to help programmers get hands-on practice with the new components. Answers to the exercises, along with all code examples, are available on the Web. Appendixes comprise a summary of headers included in or extended by the TR1 library, as well as guidelines on how to use the components safely in multithreaded applications. The C++ Standard Library Extensions is for any programmer who wants to get a jump on the revised standard. It also makes the perfect companion to The C++ Standard Library, by Nicolai Josuttis, both books being tutorials and references essential for using C++ more effectively.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=62KbFFZxYKwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2006-07-21', false);

The kernel is Linux--in the case of the Linux operating system, it''s the only bit of software to which the term "Linux" applies. The kernel handles all the requests or completed I/O operations and determines which programs will share its processing time, and in what order. Responsible for the sophisticated memory management of the whole system, the Linux kernel is the force behind the legendary Linux efficiency. The new edition ofUnderstanding the Linux Kerneltakes you on a guided tour through the most significant data structures, many algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond the superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work inside their machine. Relevant segments of code are dissected and discussed line by line. The book covers more than just the functioning of the code, it explains the theoretical underpinnings for why Linux does things the way it does. The new edition of the book has been updated to cover version 2.4 of the kernel, which is quite different from version 2.2: the virtual memory system is entirely new, support for multiprocessor systems is improved, and whole new classes of hardware devices have been added. The authors explore each new feature in detail. Other topics in the book include: Memory management including file buffering, process swapping, and Direct memory Access (DMA) The Virtual Filesystem and the Second Extended Filesystem Process creation and scheduling Signals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device drivers Timing Synchronization in the kernel Interprocess Communication (IPC) Program execution Understanding the Linux Kernel, Second Edition will acquaint you with all the inner workings of Linux, but is more than just an academic exercise.

Concepts are clearly illustrated and readers are guided, step by step, toward how to answer the following questions: What will we build? How big will it be? When must it be done? How much can I really complete by then? You will first learn what makes a good plan-and then what makes it agile. Using the techniques in Agile Estimating and Planning , you can stay agile from start to finish, saving time, conserving resources, and accomplishing more. Highlights include: Why conventional prescriptive planning fails and why agile planning works How to estimate feature size using story points and ideal days–and when to use each How and when to re-estimate How to prioritize features using both financial and nonfinancial approaches How to split large features into smaller, more manageable ones How to plan iterations and predict your team''s initial rate of progress How to schedule projects that have unusually high uncertainty or schedule-related risk How to estimate projects that will be worked on by multiple teams Agile Estimating and Planning supports any agile, semiagile, or iterative process, including Scrum, XP, Feature-Driven Development, Crystal, Adaptive Software Development, DSDM, Unified Process, and many more.

It details 30 requirement “patterns” offering realistic examples for situation-specific guidance for building effective software requirements. Each pattern explains what a requirement needs to convey, offers potential questions to ask, points out potential pitfalls, suggests extra requirements, and other advice. This book also provides guidance on how to write other kinds of information that belong in a requirements specification, such as assumptions, a glossary, and document history and references, and how to structure a requirements specification. A disturbing proportion of computer systems are judged to be inadequate; many are not even delivered; more are late or over budget. Studies consistently show one of the single biggest causes is poorly defined requirements: not properly defining what a system is for and what it’s supposed to do. Even a modest contribution to improving requirements offers the prospect of saving businesses part of a large sum of wasted investment. This guide emphasizes this important requirement need—determining what a software system needs to do before spending time on development. Expertly written, this book details solutions that have worked in the past, with guidance for modifying patterns to fit individual needs—giving developers the valuable advice they need for building effective software requirements', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=toVvi0xH-vIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', '2010-04-19', false);

We dangle goodies (from candy bars to sales commissions) in front of people in the same way that we train the family pet. Since its publication in 1993, this groundbreaking book has persuaded countless parents, teachers, and managers that attempts to manipulate people with incentives may seem to work in the short run, but they ultimately fail and even do lasting harm. Drawing from hundreds of studies, Kohn demonstrates that we actually do inferior work when we are enticed with money, grades, or other incentives—and are apt to lose interest in whatever we were bribed to do. Promising goodies to children for good behavior, meanwhile, can never produce anything more than temporary obedience. Even praise can become a verbal bribe that gets kids hooked on our approval. Rewards and punishments are two sides of the same coin—and the coin doesn’t buy much. What is needed, Kohn explains, is an alternative to both ways of controlling people. Hence, he offers practical strategies for parents, teachers, and managers to replace carrots and sticks. Seasoned with humor and familiar examples, Punished by Rewards presents an argument that is unsettling to hear but impossible to dismiss.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-fFsZWg-JfAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '1999-09-30', false);

Distributed software turns a collection of networked computers into a distributed system. It presents the user with a single-system image and gives the system its personality. Software can turn a network of computers into a transaction processor, a supercomputer, or even a novel design of your own. Some of the techniques used in this book''s distributed algorithms might be new to many readers, so several of the chapters are dedicated to such topics. You will learn about the hardware needed to network several PCs, the operating system files that need to be changed to support that network, and the multitasking and the interprocess communications skills needed to put the network to good use.

But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer–but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code–lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code–of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understanding How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2008-08-01', false);

If you’ve never read Effective C++ and you think you know everything about C++, think again.” — Steve Schirripa, Software Engineer, Google “C++ and the C++ community have grown up in the last fifteen years, and the third edition of Effective C++ reflects this. The clear and precise style of the book is evidence of Scott’s deep insight and distinctive ability to impart knowledge.” — Gerhard Kreuzer, Research and Development Engineer, Siemens AG The first two editions of Effective C++ were embraced by hundreds of thousands of programmers worldwide. The reason is clear: Scott Meyers’ practical approach to C++ describes the rules of thumb used by the experts — the things they almost always do or almost always avoid doing — to produce clear, correct, efficient code. The book is organized around 55 specific guidelines, each of which describes a way to write better C++. Each is backed by concrete examples. For this third edition, more than half the content is new, including added chapters on managing resources and using templates. Topics from the second edition have been extensively revised to reflect modern design considerations, including exceptions, design patterns, and multithreading. Important features of Effective C++ include: Expert guidance on the design of effective classes, functions, templates, and inheritance hierarchies.

The author has a deep background and gives us a tour de force of the emerging agile methods.” —Tom Gilb The agile model of software development has taken the world by storm. Now, in Agile Software Development, Second Edition, one of agile’s leading pioneers updates his Jolt Productivity award-winning book to reflect all that’s been learned about agile development since its original introduction. Alistair Cockburn begins by updating his powerful model of software development as a “cooperative game of invention and communication.” Among the new ideas he introduces: harnessing competition without damaging collaboration; learning lessons from lean manufacturing; and balancing strategies for communication. Cockburn also explains how the cooperative game is played in business and on engineering projects, not just software development Next, he systematically illuminates the agile model, shows how it has evolved, and answers the questions developers and project managers ask most often, including · Where does agile development fit in our organization? · How do we blend agile ideas with other ideas? · How do we extend agile ideas more broadly? Cockburn takes on crucial misconceptions that cause agile projects to fail. For example, you’ll learn why encoding project management strategies into fixed processes can lead to ineffective strategy decisions and costly mistakes. You’ll also find a thoughtful discussion of the controversial relationship between agile methods and user experience design. Cockburn turns to the practical challenges of constructing agile methodologies for your own teams. You’ll learn how to tune and continuously reinvent your methodologies, and how to manage incomplete communication. This edition contains important new contributions on these and other topics: · Agile and CMMI · Introducing agile from the top down · Revisiting “custom contracts” · Creating change with “stickers” In addition, Cockburn updates his discussion of the Crystal methodologies, which utilize his “cooperative game” as their central metaphor. If you’re new to agile development, this book will help you succeed the first time out. If you’ve used agile methods before, Cockburn’s techniques will make you even more effective.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i39yimbrzh4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2006-10-19', false);

Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. This groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours— sometimes even minutes–no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base. Jez Humble and David Farley begin by presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-risk delivery process. Next, they introduce the “deployment pipeline,” an automated process for managing all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the “ecosystem” needed to support continuous delivery, from infrastructure, data and configuration management to governance. The authors introduce state-of-the-art techniques, including automated infrastructure management and data migration, and the use of virtualization. For each, they review key issues, identify best practices, and demonstrate how to mitigate risks. Coverage includes • Automating all facets of building, integrating, testing, and deploying software • Implementing deployment pipelines at team and organizational levels • Improving collaboration between developers, testers, and operations • Developing features incrementally on large and distributed teams • Implementing an effective configuration management strategy • Automating acceptance testing, from analysis to implementation • Testing capacity and other non-functional requirements • Implementing continuous deployment and zero-downtime releases • Managing infrastructure, data, components and dependencies • Navigating risk management, compliance, and auditing Whether you’re a developer, systems administrator, tester, or manager, this book will help your organization move from idea to release faster than ever—so you can deliver value to your business rapidly and reliably.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6ADDuzere-YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2010-07-27', false);

Biting and Humorous Tales of a software Engineering Manager', 'The humor and insights in the 2nd Edition of Managing Humans are drawn from Michael Lopp''s management experiences at Apple, Netscape, Symantec, and Borland, among others. This book is full of stories based on companies in the Silicon Valley where people have been known to yell at each other and occasionally throw chairs. It is a place full of dysfunctional bright people who are in an incredible hurry to find the next big thing so they can strike it rich and then do it all over again. Among these people are managers, a strange breed of people who, through a mystical organizational ritual, have been given power over the future and bank accounts of many others. Whether you''re an aspiring manager, a current manager, or just wondering what the heck a manager does all day, there is a story in this book that will speak to you—and help you survive and prosper amongst the general craziness. Lopp''s straight-from-the-hip style is unlike any other writer on management. He pulls no punches and tells stories he probably shouldn''t. But they are massively instructive and cut to the heart of the matter whether it''s dealing with your boss, handling a slacker, hiring top guns, or seeing a knotty project through to completion. This second editions expands on the management essentials. It will explain why we hate meetings, but must have them, it carefully documents the right way to have a 1-on-1, and it documents the perils of not listening to your team. Writing code is easy. Managing humans is not. You need a book to help you do it, and this is it. What you’ll learn How to lead geeks How to handle conflict How to hire well How to motivate employees How to manage your boss How to say no How to handle stressed people freaking out How to improve your social IQ How to run a meeting well And much more Who this book is for This book is designed for managers and would-be managers staring at the role of a manager wondering why they would ever leave the safe world of bits and bytes for the messy world of managing humans. The book covers handling conflict, managing wildly differing personality types, infusing innovation into insane product schedules, and figuring out how to build a lasting and useful engineering culture.

They regard C++ as inherently slow and inappropriate for performance-critical applications. Consequently, C++ has had little success penetrating domains such as networking, operating system kernels, device drivers, and others. "Efficient C++" explodes that myth. Written by two authors with first-hand experience wringing the last ounce of performance from commercial C++ applications, this book demonstrates the potential of C++ to produce highly efficient programs. The book reveals practical, everyday object-oriented design principles and C++ coding techniques that can yield large performance improvements. It points out common pitfalls in both design and code that generate hidden operating costs. This book focuses on combining C++''s power and flexibility with high performance and scalability, resulting in the best of both worlds. Specific topics include temporary objects, memory management, templates, inheritance, virtual functions, inlining, reference-counting, STL, and much more. With this book, you will have a valuable compendium of the best performance techniques at your fingertips. 0201379503B04062001', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IR-MQiktobMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2015-01-01', false);

But what if your “efficient” company—the one with the reduced headcount and the “stretch” goals—is actually slowing down and losing money? What if your employees are burning out doing the work of two or more people, leaving them no time for planning, prioritizing, or even lunch? What if you’re losing employees faster than you can hire them? What if your superefficient company is suddenly falling behind? Tom DeMarco, a leading management consultant to both Fortune 500 and up-and-coming companies, has discovered a counterintuitive principle that explains why efficiency improvement can sometimes make a company slow. If your real organizational goal is to become fast (responsive and agile), then he proposes that what you need is not more efficiency, but more slack. What is “slack”? Slack is the degree of freedom in a company that allows it to change. It could be something as simple as adding an assistant to a department, letting high-priced talent spend less time at the photo copier and more time making key decisions. Slack could also appear in the way a company treats employees: instead of loading them up with overwork, a company designed with slack allows its people room to breathe, increase effectiveness, and reinvent themselves. In thirty—three short chapters filled with creative learning tools and charts, you and your company can learn how to: ∑make sense of the Efficiency/Flexibility quandary ∑run directly toward risk instead of away from it ∑strengthen the creative role of middle management ∑make change and growth work together for even greater profits A innovative approach that works for new- and old-economy companies alike, this revolutionary handbook will debunk commonly held assumptions about real-world management, and give you and your company a brand-new model for achieving and maintaining true effectiveness—and a healthier bottom line.

Unfortunately, reliable guidance on Agile management has been scarce indeed. Now, leading Agile manager Jurgen Appelo fills that gap, introducing a realistic approach to leading, managing, and growing your Agile team or organization. Writing for current managers and developers moving into management, Appelo shares insights that are grounded in modern complex systems theory, reflecting the intense complexity of modern software development. Appelo’s Management 3.0 model recognizes that today’s organizations are living, networked systems; and that management is primarily about people and relationships. Management 3.0 doesn’t offer mere checklists or prescriptions to follow slavishly; rather, it deepens your understanding of how organizations and Agile teams work and gives you tools to solve your own problems. Drawing on his extensive experience as an Agile manager, the author identifies the most important practices of Agile management and helps you improve each of them. Coverage includes • Getting beyond “Management 1.0” control and “Management 2.0” fads • Understanding how complexity affects your organization • Keeping your people active, creative, innovative, and motivated • Giving teams the care and authority they need to grow on their own • Defining boundaries so teams can succeed in alignment with business goals • Sowing the seeds for a culture of software craftsmanship • Crafting an organizational network that promotes success • Implementing continuous improvement that actually works Thoroughly pragmatic–and never trendy–Jurgen Appelo’s Management 3.0 helps you bring greater agility to any software organization, team, or project.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yoh9mTBwj-sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2010-12-28', false);

In the future, a 100-fold increase in mobile data traffic is expected. That will necessitate further improvements to 3GPP LTE (Long-Term Evolution) and create limitless opportunities for engineers who understand the technology and how to apply it to deliver enhanced services. Long Term Evolution: 3GPP LTE Radio and Cellular Technology outlines the best way to position yourself now for future success. With coverage ranging from basic concepts to current research, this comprehensive reference contains technical information about all aspects of 3GPP LTE. It details low chip rate, high-speed downlink/uplink packet access (HSxPA)/TDSCDMA EV 1x, LTE TDD, and 3G TDD. It introduces new technologies and covers methodologies to study the performance of frequency allocation schemes. The authors also discuss the proposed architecture of Mobile IPRR and distributed dynamic architecture in wireless communication, covering performance evaluation of the TD-SCDMA LTE System. With each passing day, more and more users are demanding mobile broadband data access everywhere, to facilitate synchronization of e-mails, Internet access, specific applications, and file downloads to mobile devices such as cell phones, smart phones, PDAs, and notebooks. LTE, successor to the 3G mobile radio network, is essential to creating radio coverage in the rollout phase and high capacity all over the radio cell in the long term. The 3GPP LTE will become increasingly crucial to supporting the high demand of data traffic rates generated by future mobile user terminals.

Until now. In Adrenaline Junkies and Template Zombies, the six principal consultants of The Atlantic Systems Guild present the patterns of behavior they most often observe at the dozens of IT firms they transform each year, around the world. The result is a quick-read guide to identifying nearly ninety typical scenarios, drawing on a combined one-hundred-and-fifty years of project management experience. Project by project, you’ll improve the accuracy of your hunches and your ability to act on them. The patterns are presented in an easy-reference format, with names designed to ease communication with your teammates. In just a few words, you can describe what’s happening on your project. Citing the patterns of behavior can help you quickly move those above and below you to the next step on your project. You’ll find classic patterns such as these: News Improvement Management by Mood Ring Piling On Rattle Yer Dags Natural Authority Food++ Fridge Door and more than eighty more! Not every pattern will be evident in your organization, and not every pattern is necessarily good or bad.

Founders at Work: Stories of Startups'' Early Days is a collection of interviews with founders of famous technology companies about what happened in the very earliest days. These people are celebrities now. What was it like when they were just a couple friends with an idea? Founders like Steve Wozniak (Apple), Caterina Fake (Flickr), Mitch Kapor (Lotus), Max Levchin (PayPal), and Sabeer Bhatia (Hotmail) tell you in their own words about their surprising and often very funny discoveries as they learned how to build a company. Where did they get the ideas that made them rich? How did they convince investors to back them? What went wrong, and how did they recover? Nearly all technical people have thought of one day starting or working for a startup. For them, this book is the closest you can come to being a fly on the wall at a successful startup, to learn how it''s done. But ultimately these interviews are required reading for anyone who wants to understand business, because startups are business reduced to its essence. The reason their founders become rich is that startups do what businesses do—create value—more intensively than almost any other part of the economy. How? What are the secrets that make successful startups so insanely productive?

Few companies in history have ever been as successful and as admired as Google, the company that has transformed the Internet and become an indispensable part of our lives. How has Google done it? Veteran technology reporter Steven Levy was granted unprecedented access to the company, and in this revelatory book he takes readers inside Google headquarters—the Googleplex—to show how Google works. While they were still students at Stanford, Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin revolutionized Internet search. They followed this brilliant innovation with another, as two of Google’s earliest employees found a way to do what no one else had: make billions of dollars from Internet advertising. With this cash cow, Google was able to expand dramatically and take on other transformative projects: more efficient data centers, open-source cell phones, free Internet video (YouTube), cloud computing, digitizing books, and much more. The key to Google’s success in all these businesses, Levy reveals, is its engineering mind-set and adoption of such Internet values as speed, openness, experimentation, and risk taking. After its unapologetically elitist approach to hiring, Google pampers its engineers—free food and dry cleaning, on-site doctors and masseuses—and gives them all the resources they need to succeed. Even today, with a workforce of more than 23,000, Larry Page signs off on every hire. But has Google lost its innovative edge? With its newest initiative, social networking, Google is chasing a successful competitor for the first time. Some employees are leaving the company for smaller, nimbler start-ups. Can the company that famously decided not to be evil still compete? No other book has ever turned Google inside out as Levy does with In the Plex.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V1u1f8sv3k8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2011-04-12', false);

This book builds on the success of its predecessor, offering the same comprehensive system-level understanding built on explanations of the underlying theory, now expanded to include complete coverage of Release 9 and the developing specifications for LTE-Advanced. The book is a collaborative effort of more than 40 key experts representing over 20 companies actively participating in the development of LTE, as well as academia. The book highlights practical implications, illustrates the expected performance, and draws comparisons with the well-known WCDMA/HSPA standards. The authors not only pay special attention to the physical layer, giving an insight into the fundamental concepts of OFDMA-FDMA and MIMO, but also cover the higher protocol layers and system architecture to enable the reader to gain an overall understanding of the system. Key New Features: Comprehensively updated with the latest changes of the LTE Release 8 specifications, including improved coverage of Radio Resource Management RF aspects and performance requirements Provides detailed coverage of the new LTE Release 9 features, including: eMBMS, dual-layer beamforming, user equipment positioning, home eNodeBs / femtocells and pico cells and self-optimizing networks Evaluates the LTE system performance Introduces LTE-Advanced, explaining its context and motivation, as well as the key new features including: carrier aggregation, relaying, high-order MIMO, and Cooperative Multi-Point transmission (CoMP).

Until now, however, requirements and Agile methods have rarely coexisted peacefully. For many enterprises considering Agile approaches, the absence of effective and scalable Agile requirements processes has been a showstopper for Agile adoption. In Agile Software Requirements, Dean Leffingwell shows exactly how to create effective requirements in Agile environments. Part I presents the “big picture” of Agile requirements in the enterprise, and describes an overall process model for Agile requirements at the project team, program, and portfolio levels Part II describes a simple and lightweight, yet comprehensive model that Agile project teams can use to manage requirements Part III shows how to develop Agile requirements for complex systems that require the cooperation of multiple teams Part IV guides enterprises in developing Agile requirements for ever-larger “systems of systems,” application suites, and product portfolios This book will help you leverage the benefits of Agile without sacrificing the value of effective requirements discovery and analysis.

Our Iceberg Is Melting is a simple story about doing well under the stress and uncertainty of rapid change. Based on the award-winning work of Harvard Business School’s John Kotter, it can help you and your colleagues thrive during tough times. On an iceberg near the coast of Antarctica, group of beautiful emperor pen­guins live as they have for many years. Then one curious bird discovers a potentially devastating problem threatening their home—and almost no one listens to him. The characters in the story—Fred, Alice, Louis, Buddy, the Professor, and NoNo—are like people you probably recognize in your own organization, including yourself. Their tale is one of resistance to change and heroic action, seemingly intractable obstacles and clever tactics for dealing with those obstacles. The penguins offer an inspiring model as we all struggle to adapt to new circumstances. Our Iceberg Is Melting is based on John Kotter''s pioneer­ing research into the eight steps that can produce needed change in any sort of group. After finishing the story, you''ll have a powerful framework for influencing your own team, no matter how big or small. This tenth anniversary edition preserves the text of the timeless story, together with new illustrations, a revised afterword, and a Q&A with the authors about the responses they''ve gotten over the past decade.

Speedy and affordable multicore hardware is driving the demand for high-performing applications, and you can leverage the Java platform to bring these applications to life. Concurrency on the Java platform has evolved, from the synchronization model of JDK to software transactional memory (STM) and actor-based concurrency. This book is the first to show you all these concurrency styles so you can compare and choose what works best for your applications. You''ll learn the benefits of each of these models, when and how to use them, and what their limitations are. Through hands-on exercises, you''ll learn how to avoid shared mutable state and how to write good, elegant, explicit synchronization-free programs so you can create easy and safe concurrent applications. The techniques you learn in this book will take you from dreading concurrency to mastering and enjoying it. Best of all, you can work with Java or a JVM language of your choice - Clojure, JRuby, Groovy, or Scala - to reap the growing power of multicore hardware. If you are a Java programmer, you''d need JDK 1.5 or later and the Akka 1.0 library.

Unfortunately, reliable guidance on Agile management has been scarce indeed. Now, leading Agile manager Jurgen Appelo fills that gap, introducing a realistic approach to leading, managing, and growing your Agile team or organization. Writing for current managers and developers moving into management, Appelo shares insights that are grounded in modern complex systems theory, reflecting the intense complexity of modern software development. Appelo’s Management 3.0 model recognizes that today’s organizations are living, networked systems; and that management is primarily about people and relationships. Management 3.0 doesn’t offer mere checklists or prescriptions to follow slavishly; rather, it deepens your understanding of how organizations and Agile teams work and gives you tools to solve your own problems. Drawing on his extensive experience as an Agile manager, the author identifies the most important practices of Agile management and helps you improve each of them. Coverage includes • Getting beyond “Management 1.0” control and “Management 2.0” fads • Understanding how complexity affects your organization • Keeping your people active, creative, innovative, and motivated • Giving teams the care and authority they need to grow on their own • Defining boundaries so teams can succeed in alignment with business goals • Sowing the seeds for a culture of software craftsmanship • Crafting an organizational network that promotes success • Implementing continuous improvement that actually works Thoroughly pragmatic–and never trendy–Jurgen Appelo’s Management 3.0 helps you bring greater agility to any software organization, team, or project.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yoh9mTBwj-sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2010-12-28', false);

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.

While quality, in terms of the phone''s stability, performance and behaviour on the network, originate from good design, the only way to be sure of quality is by testing it. This makes testing a very important part of any mobile phone''s life cycle, from development through to manufacture and beyond, touching a number of different disciplines and departments. Testing UMTS is divided in three sections. Section One provides an overview of major types of testing and the organisations and tasks involved. In particular it looks at what is involved in conformance testing and device certification. Section Two is more technical and looks at the UMTS standard itself, working through the protocol layers. Future trends and their impact on testing mobile devices are examined in Section Three, including the emergence of new technologies both in the access network and the core network and the evolution of new testing methodologies. Examines UMTS and the testing of UMTS devices which are huge areas in the testing process Provides essential information on processes and techniques for mobile phone testing Operation of the UMTS standard is described from a test point of view Focuses on most important areas of the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard from a test perspective Offers advice on products, services and resources that aid the testing process. This book is an ideal text for engineers and managers who are either directly involved in the process of testing UMTS mobiles, or who are looking for an understanding of what is involved in testing. Professionals involved in the development of UMTS mobiles, integration and verification, conformance testing, operator acceptance testing, manufacturing and servicing will find this book indispensable.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v8vkA-N6xycC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2008-04-30', false);

TDD is based on a simple idea: Write tests for your code before you write the code itself. However, this "simple" idea takes skill and judgment to do well. Now there''s a practical guide to TDD that takes you beyond the basic concepts. Drawing on a decade of experience building real-world systems, two TDD pioneers show how to let tests guide your development and “grow” software that is coherent, reliable, and maintainable. Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce describe the processes they use, the design principles they strive to achieve, and some of the tools that help them get the job done. Through an extended worked example, you’ll learn how TDD works at multiple levels, using tests to drive the features and the object-oriented structure of the code, and using Mock Objects to discover and then describe relationships between objects. Along the way, the book systematically addresses challenges that development teams encounter with TDD—from integrating TDD into your processes to testing your most difficult features. Coverage includes Implementing TDD effectively: getting started, and maintaining your momentum throughout the project Creating cleaner, more expressive, more sustainable code Using tests to stay relentlessly focused on sustaining quality Understanding how TDD, Mock Objects, and Object-Oriented Design come together in the context of a real software development project Using Mock Objects to guide object-oriented designs Succeeding where TDD is difficult: managing complex test data, and testing persistence and concurrency', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QJA3dM8Uix0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2009-10-12', false);

This book can help get those projects in on-time with design patterns. The author carefully takes into account the special concerns found in designing and developing embedded applications specifically concurrency, communication, speed, and memory usage. Patterns are given in UML (Unified Modeling Language) with examples including ANSI C for direct and practical application to C code. A basic C knowledge is a prerequisite for the book while UML notation and terminology is included. General C programming books do not include discussion of the contraints found within embedded system design. The practical examples give the reader an understanding of the use of UML and OO (Object Oriented) designs in a resource-limited environment. Also included are two chapters on state machines. The beauty of this book is that it can help you today. .

Just as natural pearls grow from grains of sand that irritate oysters, programming pearls have grown from real problems that have irritated real programmers. With origins beyond solid engineering, in the realm of insight and creativity, Bentley’s pearls offer unique and clever solutions to those nagging problems. Illustrated by programs designed as much for fun as for instruction, the book is filled with lucid and witty descriptions of practical programming techniques and fundamental design principles. It is not at all surprising that Programming Pearls has been so highly valued by programmers at every level of experience. In this revision, the first in 14 years, Bentley has substantially updated his essays to reflect current programming methods and environments. In addition, there are three new essays on testing, debugging, and timing set representations string problems All the original programs have been rewritten, and an equal amount of new code has been generated. Implementations of all the programs, in C or C++, are now available on the Web. What remains the same in this new edition is Bentley’s focus on the hard core of programming problems and his delivery of workable solutions to those problems. Whether you are new to Bentley’s classic or are revisiting his work for some fresh insight, the book is sure to make your own list of favorites.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4gX0CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2016-04-21', false);

The widespread adoption of agile methods has brought the need for effective testing into the limelight, and agile projects have transformed the role of testers. Much of a tester’s function, however, remains largely misunderstood. What is the true role of a tester? Do agile teams actually need members with QA backgrounds? What does it really mean to be an “agile tester?” Two of the industry’s most experienced agile testing practitioners and consultants, Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory, have teamed up to bring you the definitive answers to these questions and many others. In Agile Testing, Crispin and Gregory define agile testing and illustrate the tester’s role with examples from real agile teams. They teach you how to use the agile testing quadrants to identify what testing is needed, who should do it, and what tools might help. The book chronicles an agile software development iteration from the viewpoint of a tester and explains the seven key success factors of agile testing. Readers will come away from this book understanding How to get testers engaged in agile development Where testers and QA managers fit on an agile team What to look for when hiring an agile tester How to transition from a traditional cycle to agile development How to complete testing activities in short iterations How to use tests to successfully guide development How to overcome barriers to test automation This book is a must for agile testers, agile teams, their managers, and their customers.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=68_lhPvoKS8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2008-12-30', false);

A metaprogram is a program that generates or manipulates program code. Ever since generic programming was introduced to C++, programmers have discovered myriad "template tricks" for manipulating programs as they are compiled, effectively eliminating the barrier between program and metaprogram. While excitement among C++ experts about these capabilities has reached the community at large, their practical application remains out of reach for most programmers. This book explains what metaprogramming is and how it is best used. It provides the foundation you''ll need to use the template metaprogramming effectively in your own work. This book is aimed at any programmer who is comfortable with idioms of the Standard Template Library (STL). C++ power-users will gain a new insight into their existing work and a new fluency in the domain of metaprogramming. Intermediate-level programmers who have learned a few advanced template techniques will see where these tricks fit in the big picture and will gain the conceptual foundation to use them with discipline. Programmers who have caught the scent of metaprogramming, but for whom it is still mysterious, will finally gain a clear understanding of how, when, and why it works. All readers will leave with a new tool of unprecedented power at their disposal—the Boost Metaprogramming Library.

This book builds on the success of its predecessor, offering the same comprehensive system-level understanding built on explanations of the underlying theory, now expanded to include complete coverage of Release 9 and the developing specifications for LTE-Advanced. The book is a collaborative effort of more than 40 key experts representing over 20 companies actively participating in the development of LTE, as well as academia. The book highlights practical implications, illustrates the expected performance, and draws comparisons with the well-known WCDMA/HSPA standards. The authors not only pay special attention to the physical layer, giving an insight into the fundamental concepts of OFDMA-FDMA and MIMO, but also cover the higher protocol layers and system architecture to enable the reader to gain an overall understanding of the system. Key New Features: Comprehensively updated with the latest changes of the LTE Release 8 specifications, including improved coverage of Radio Resource Management RF aspects and performance requirements Provides detailed coverage of the new LTE Release 9 features, including: eMBMS, dual-layer beamforming, user equipment positioning, home eNodeBs / femtocells and pico cells and self-optimizing networks Evaluates the LTE system performance Introduces LTE-Advanced, explaining its context and motivation, as well as the key new features including: carrier aggregation, relaying, high-order MIMO, and Cooperative Multi-Point transmission (CoMP).

It is divided into three parts plus several appendices. Part I provides a foundation for real-time C++ by covering language technologies, including object-oriented methods, template programming and optimization. Next, part II presents detailed descriptions of a variety of C++ components that are widely used in microcontroller programming. It details some of C++’s most powerful language elements, such as class types, templates and the STL, to develop components for microcontroller register access, low-level drivers, custom memory management, embedded containers, multitasking, etc. Finally, part III describes mathematical methods and generic utilities that can be employed to solve recurring problems in real-time C++. The appendices include a brief C++ language tutorial, information on the real-time C++ development environment and instructions for building GNU GCC cross-compilers and a microcontroller circuit. For this third edition, the most recent specification of C++17 in ISO/IEC 14882:2017 is used throughout the text. Several sections on new C++17 functionality have been added, and various others reworked to reflect changes in the standard. Also several new sample projects are introduced and existing ones extended, and various user suggestions have been incorporated. To facilitate portability, no libraries other than those specified in the language standard itself are used. Efficiency is always in focus and numerous examples are backed up with real-time performance measurements and size analyses that quantify the true costs of the code down to the very last byte and microsecond. The target audience of this book mainly consists of students and professionals interested in real-time C++. Readers should be familiar with C or another programming language and will benefit most if they have had some previous experience with microcontroller electronics and the performance and size issues prevalent in embedded systems programming.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0XZZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2018-05-02', false);

The challenge is learning to use those features effectively—so that your software is correct, efficient, maintainable, and portable. That’s where this practical book comes in. It describes how to write truly great software using C++11 and C++14—i.e. using modern C++. Topics include: The pros and cons of braced initialization, noexcept specifications, perfect forwarding, and smart pointer make functions The relationships among std::move, std::forward, rvalue references, and universal references Techniques for writing clear, correct, effective lambda expressions How std::atomic differs from volatile, how each should be used, and how they relate to C++''s concurrency API How best practices in "old" C++ programming (i.e., C++98) require revision for software development in modern C++ Effective Modern C++ follows the proven guideline-based, example-driven format of Scott Meyers'' earlier books, but covers entirely new material. "After I learned the C++ basics, I then learned how to use C++ in production code from Meyer''s series of Effective C++ books.

I remember mine. It was a little graphics program I wrote on an early PC. I started programming later than most of my friends. Sure, I''d seen computers when I was a kid. I remember being really impressed by a minicomputer I once saw in an office, but for years I never had a chance to even sit at a computer. Later, when I was a teenager, some friends of mine bought a couple of the first TRS-80s. I was interested, but I was actually a bit apprehensive, too. I knew that if I started to play with computers, I''d get sucked into it. It just looked too cool. I don''t know why I knew myself so well, but I held back. Later, in college, a roommate of mine had a computer, and I bought a C compiler so that I could teach myself programming. Then it began. I stayed up night after night trying things out, poring through the source code of the emacs editor that came with the compiler. It was addictive, it was challenging, and I loved it. I hope you''ve had experiences like thismdjust the raw joy of making things work on a computer. Nearly every programmer I ask has. That joy is part of what got us into this work, but where is it day to day? A few years ago, I gave my friend Erik Meade a call after I''d finished work one night. I knew that Erik had just started a consulting gig with a new team, so I asked him, "How are they doing?" He said, "They''re writing legacy code, man." That was one of the few times in my life when I was sucker-punched by a coworker''s statement. I felt it right in my gut. Erik had given words to the precise feeling that I often get when I visit teams for the first time. They are trying very hard, but at the end of the day, because of schedule pressure, the weight of history, or a lack of any better code to compare their efforts to, many people are writing legacy code. What is legacy code? I''ve used the term without defining it. Let''s look at the strict definition: Legacy code is code that we''ve gotten from someone else. Maybe our company acquired code from another company; maybe people on the original team moved on to other projects. Legacy code is somebody else''s code. But in programmer-speak, the term means much more than that. The termlegacy codehas taken on more shades of meaning and more weight over time. What do you think about when you hear the termlegacy code? If you are at all like me, you think of tangled, unintelligible structure, code that you have to change but don''t really understand. You think of sleepless nights trying to add in features that should be easy to add, and you think of demoralization, the sense that everyone on the team is so sick of a code base that it seems beyond care, the sort of code that you just wish would die. Part of you feels bad for even thinking about making it better. It seems unworthy of your efforts. That definition of legacy code has nothing to do with who wrote it. Code can degrade in many ways, and many of them have nothing to do with whether the code came from another team. In the industry,legacy codeis often used as a slang term for difficult-to-change code that we don''t understand. But over years of working with teams, helping them get past serious code problems, I''ve arrived at a different definition. To me,legacy codeis simply code without tests. I''ve gotten some grief for this definition. What do tests have to do with whether code is bad? To me, the answer is straightforward, and it is a point that I elaborate throughout the book: Code without tests is bad code. It doesn''t matter how well written it is; it doesn''t matter how pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated it is. With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don''t know if our code is getting better or worse. You might think that this is severe. What about clean code? If a code base is very clean and well structured, isn''t that enough? Well, make no mistake. I love clean code. I love it more than most people I know, but while clean code is good, it''s not enough. Teams take serious chances when they try to make large changes without tests. It is like doing aerial gymnastics without a net. It requires incredible skill and a clear understanding of what can happen at every step. Knowing precisely what will happen if you change a couple of variables is often like knowing whether another gymnast is going to catch your arms after you come out of a somersault. If you are on a team with code that clear, you are in a better position than most programmers. In my work, I''ve noticed that teams with that degree of clarity in all of their code are rare. They seem like a statistical anomaly. And, you know what? If they don''t have supporting tests, their code changes still appear to be slower than those of teams that do. Yes, teams do get better and start to write clearer code, but it takes a long time for older code to get clearer. In many cases, it will never happen completely. Because of this, I have no problem defining legacy code as code without tests. It is a good working definition, and it points to a solution. I''ve been talking about tests quite a bit so far, but this book is not about testing. This book is about being able to confidently make changes in any code base. In the following chapters, I describe techniques that you can use to understand code, get it under test, refactor it, and add features. One thing that you will notice as you read this book is that it is not a book about pretty code. The examples that I use in the book are fabricated because I work under nondisclosure agreements with clients. But in many of the examples, I''ve tried to preserve the spirit of code that I''ve seen in the field. I won''t say that the examples are always representative. There certainly are oases of great code out there, but, frankly, there are also pieces of code that are far worse than anything I can use as an example in this book. Aside from client confidentiality, I simply couldn''t put code like that in this book without boring you to tears and burying important points in a morass of detail. As a result, many of the examples are relatively brief. If you look at one of them and think "No, he doesn''t understandmdmy methods are much larger than that and much worse," please look at the advice that I am giving at face value and see if it applies, even if the example seems simpler. The techniques here have been tested on substantially large pieces of code. It is just a limitation of the book format that makes examples smaller. In particular, when you see ellipses (el) in a code fragment like this, you can read them as "insert 500 lines of ugly code here": m_pDispatcher->register(listener);...m_nMargins++; If this book is not about pretty code, it is even less about pretty design. Good design should be a goal for all of us, but in legacy code, it is something that we arrive at in discrete steps. In some of the chapters, I describe ways of adding new code to existing code bases and show how to add it with good design principles in mind. You can start to grow areas of very good high-quality code in legacy code bases, but don''t be surprised if some of the steps you take to make changes involve making some code slightly uglier. This work is like surgery. We have to make incisions, and we have to move through the guts and suspend some aesthetic judgment. Could this patient''s major organs and viscera be better than they are? Yes. So do we just forget about his immediate problem, sew him up again, and tell him to eat right and train for a marathon? We could, but what we really need to do is take the patient as he is, fix what''s wrong, and move him to a healthier state. He might never become an Olympic athlete, but we can''t let "best" be the enemy of "better." Code bases can become healthier and easier to work in. When a patient feels a little better, often that is the time when you can help him make commitments to a healthier life style. That is what we are shooting for with legacy code. We are trying to get to the point at which we are used to ease; we expect it and actively attempt to make code change easier. When we can sustain that sense on a team, design gets better. The techniques I describe are ones that I''ve discovered and learned with coworkers and clients over the course of years working with clients to try to establish control over unruly code bases. I got into this legacy code emphasis accidentally. When I first started working with Object Mentor, the bulk of my work involved helping teams with serious problems develop their skills and interactions to the point that they could regularly deliver quality code. We often used Extreme Programming practices to help teams take control of their work, collaborate intensively, and deliver. I often feel that Extreme Programming is less a way to develop software than it is a way to make a well-jelled work team that just happens to deliver great software every two weeks. From the beginning, though, there was a problem. Many of the first XP projects were "greenfield" projects. The clients I was seeing had significantly large code bases, and they were in trouble. They needed some way to get control of their work and start to deliver. Over time, I found that I was doing the same things over and over again with clients. This sense culminated in some work I was doing with a team in the financial industry. Before I''d arrived, they''d realized that unit testing was a great thing, but the tests that they were executing were full scenario tests that made multiple trips to a database and exercised large chunks of code. The tests were hard to write, and the team didn''t run them very often because they took so long to run. As I sat down with them to break dependencies and get smaller chunks of code under test, I had a terrible sense of deasjaag vu. It seemed that I was doing this sort of work with every team I met, and it was the sort of thing that no one really wanted to think about. It was just the grunge work that you do when you want to start working with your code in a controlled way, if you know how to do it. I decided then that it was worth really reflecting on how we were solving these problems and writing them down so that teams could get a leg up and start to make their code bases easier to live in. A note about the examples: I''ve used examples in several different programming languages. The bulk of the examples are written in Java, C++, and C. I picked Java because it is a very common language, and I included C++ because it presents some special challenges in a legacy environment. I picked C because it highlights many of the problems that come up in procedural legacy code. Among them, these languages cover much of the spectrum of concerns that arise in legacy code. However, if the languages you using are not covered in the examples, take a look at them anyway. Many of the techniques that I cover can be used in other languages, such as Delphi, Visual Basic, COBOL, and FORTRAN. I hope that you find the techniques in this book helpful and that they allow you to get back to what is fun about programming. Programming can be very rewarding and enjoyable work. If you don''t feel that in your day-to-day work, I hope that the techniques I offer you in this book help you find it and grow it on your team. Acknowledgements First of all, I owe a serious debt to my wife, Ann, and my children, Deborah and Ryan. Their love and support made this book and all of the learning that preceded it possible. I''d also like to thank "Uncle Bob" Martin, president and founder of Object Mentor. His rigorous pragmatic approach to development and design, separating the critical from the inconsequential, gave me something to latch upon about 10 years ago, back when it seemed that I was about to drown in a wave of unrealistic advice. And thanks, Bob, for giving me the opportunity to see more code and work with more people over the past five years than I ever imagined possible. I also have to thank Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries, and Ward Cunningham for offering me advice at times and teaching me a great deal about team work, design, and programming. Special thanks to all of the people who reviewed the drafts. The official reviewers were Sven Gorts, Robert C. Martin, Erik Meade, and Bill Wake; the unofficial reviewers were Dr. Robert Koss, James Grenning, Lowell Lindstrom, Micah Martin, Russ Rufer and the Silicon Valley Patterns Group, and James Newkirk. Thanks also to reviewers of the very early drafts I placed on the Internet. Their feedback significantly affected the direction of the book after I reorganized its format. I apologize in advance to any of you I may have left out. The early reviewers were: Darren Hobbs, Martin Lippert, Keith Nicholas, Phlip Plumlee, C. Keith Ray, Robert Blum, Bill Burris, William Caputo, Brian Marick, Steve Freeman, David Putman, Emily Bache, Dave Astels, Russel Hill, Christian Sepulveda, and Brian Christopher Robinson. Thanks also to Joshua Kerievsky who gave a key early review and Jeff Langr who helped with advice and spot reviews all through the process. The reviewers helped me polish the draft considerably, but if there are errors remaining, they are solely mine. Thanks to Martin Fowler, Ralph Johnson, Bill Opdyke, Don Roberts, and John Brant for their work in the area of refactoring. It has been inspirational. I also owe a special debt to Jay Packlick, Jacques Morel, and Kelly Mower of Sabre Holdings, and Graham Wright of Workshare Technology for their support and feedback. Special thanks also to Paul Petralia, Michelle Vincenti, Lori Lyons, Krista Hansing, and the rest of the team at Prentice-Hall. Thank you, Paul, for all of the help and encouragement that this first-time author needed. Special thanks also to Gary and Joan Feathers, April Roberts, Dr. Raimund Ege, David Lopez de Quintana, Carlos Perez, Carlos M. Rodriguez, and the late Dr. John C. Comfort for help and encouragement over the years.I also have to thank to Brian Button for the example in Chapter XX,I''m Changing the Same Code All Over the Place. He wrote that code in about an hour when we were developing a refactoring course together, and it''s become my favorite piece of teaching code. Also, special thanks to Janik Top, whose instrumentalDe Futuraserved as the soundtrack for my last few weeks of work on this book. Finally, I''d like to thank everyone whom I''ve worked with over the past few years whose insights and challenges strengthened the material in this book.

If you’re a reasonably proficient programmer who can think logically, you have all the background you’ll need. Stepanov and Rose introduce the relevant abstract algebra and number theory with exceptional clarity. They carefully explain the problems mathematicians first needed to solve, and then show how these mathematical solutions translate to generic programming and the creation of more effective and elegant code. To demonstrate the crucial role these mathematical principles play in many modern applications, the authors show how to use these results and generalized algorithms to implement a real-world public-key cryptosystem. As you read this book, you’ll master the thought processes necessary for effective programming and learn how to generalize narrowly conceived algorithms to widen their usefulness without losing efficiency. You’ll also gain deep insight into the value of mathematics to programming—insight that will prove invaluable no matter what programming languages and paradigms you use. You will learn about How to generalize a four thousand-year-old algorithm, demonstrating indispensable lessons about clarity and efficiency Ancient paradoxes, beautiful theorems, and the productive tension between continuous and discrete A simple algorithm for finding greatest common divisor (GCD) and modern abstractions that build on it Powerful mathematical approaches to abstraction How abstract algebra provides the idea at the heart of generic programming Axioms, proofs, theories, and models: using mathematical techniques to organize knowledge about your algorithms and data structures Surprising subtleties of simple programming tasks and what you can learn from them How practical implementations can exploit theoretical knowledge', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UqxYBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2014-11-13', false);

However, since then, much has changed in the world of information development. With this new title, JoAnn Hackos looks beyond the structured project of the 1980s and 1990s. Instead, she focuses on the rapidly changing projects of the 21st century and addresses how to introduce agile information development without neglecting the central focus of planning information design and development around the needs of information users. As an information-development manager, you are expected to reduce costs and project time, do more work with fewer resources and less money, and increase the value of the information you deliver. Recognizing this, Hackos has carefully designed this book to help you do precisely that.

As business needs evolve, so do the demands for QoS. The need to protect critical applications via QoS mechanisms in business networks has escalated over the past few years, primarily due to the increased frequency and sophistication of denial-of-service (DoS) and worm attacks. End-to-End QoS Network Design is a detailed handbook for planning and deploying QoS solutions to address current business needs. This book goes beyond discussing available QoS technologies and considers detailed design examples that illustrate where, when, and how to deploy various QoS features to provide validated and tested solutions for voice, video, and critical data over the LAN, WAN, and VPN. The book starts with a brief background of network infrastructure evolution and the subsequent need for QoS. It then goes on to cover the various QoS features and tools currently available and comments on their evolution and direction. The QoS requirements of voice, interactive and streaming video, and multiple classes of data applications are presented, along with an overview of the nature and effects of various types of DoS and worm attacks. QoS best-practice design principles are introduced to show how QoS mechanisms can be strategically deployed end-to-end to address application requirements while mitigating network attacks. The next section focuses on how these strategic design principles are applied to campus LAN QoS design. Considerations and detailed design recommendations specific to the access, distribution, and core layers of an enterprise campus network are presented. Private WAN QoS design is discussed in the following section, where WAN-specific considerations and detailed QoS designs are presented for leased-lines, Frame Relay, ATM, ATM-to-FR Service Interworking, and ISDN networks. Branch-specific designs include Cisco® SAFE recommendations for using Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR) for known-worm identification and policing. The final section covers Layer 3 VPN QoS design-for both MPLS and IPSec VPNs. As businesses are migrating to VPNs to meet their wide-area networking needs at lower costs, considerations specific to these topologies are required to be reflected in their customer-edge QoS designs. MPLS VPN QoS design is examined from both the enterprise and service provider''s perspectives. Additionally, IPSec VPN QoS designs cover site-to-site and teleworker contexts. Whether you are looking for an introduction to QoS principles and practices or a QoS planning and deployment guide, this book provides you with the expert advice you need to design and implement comprehensive QoS solutions.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WOPoD6cGXEsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2015-01-01', false);

The Internet and the digital environment present writers with new challenges and opportunities to reconceive creativity, authorship, and their relationship to language. Confronted with an unprecedented amount of texts and language, writers have the opportunity to move beyond the creation of new texts and manage, parse, appropriate, and reconstruct those that already exist. In addition to explaining his concept of uncreative writing, which is also the name of his popular course at the University of Pennsylvania, Goldsmith reads the work of writers who have taken up this challenge. Examining a wide range of texts and techniques, including the use of Google searches to create poetry, the appropriation of courtroom testimony, and the possibility of robo-poetics, Goldsmith joins this recent work to practices that date back to the early twentieth century. Writers and artists such as Walter Benjamin, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, and Andy Warhol embodied an ethos in which the construction or conception of a text was just as important as the resultant text itself.

DITA has grown in popularity and features since its origins as an internal grammar for structuring technical documentation at IBM. This book introduces Lightweight DITA (LwDITA, which should be read as "Lightweight DITA") as a proposed version of the DITA standard that reduces its dependence on complex Extensible Markup Language (XML) structures and simplifies its authoring experience. This volume aims to reconcile discrepancies and similarities in methods for authoring content in industry and academia and does so by reporting on DITA’s evolution through the lens of computational thinking, which has been connected in scholarship and media to initiatives for learning to code and programming. Evia’s core argument is that if technical communicators are trained with principles of rhetorical problem solving and computational thinking, they can create structured content in lightweight workflows with XML, HTML5, and Markdown designed to reduce the learning curve associated with DITA and similar authoring methodologies. At the same time, this book has the goal of making concepts of structured authoring and intelligent content easier to learn and teach in humanities-based writing and communication programs. This book is intended for practitioners and students interested in structured authoring or the DITA standard.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7AB-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2018-12-17', false);

This book will help you learn both the how of doing lean, as well as the why behind the tools, enabling you to become lean. Lean is the most important business model for competitive success today. Yet companies still struggle to sustain enduring and deep-rooted business success from their lean implementation efforts. The most important problem for these companies is becoming lean: how can they advance beyond realizing isolated gains from deploying lean tools, to fundamentally changing how they operate, think, and learn? In other words, how can companies learn to go beyond lean turnaround to achieve lean transformation? The Lean Manager: A Novel of Lean Transformation, by lean experts Michael and Freddy Ballé, addresses this critical problem. As we move from what Jim Womack, author, lean management authority, and LEI founder, calls “the era of lean tools to the era of lean management,” The Lean Manager gives companies a definitive guide for sustaining their ability to learn and improve operations and financial performance, while continually developing people. “The only way to become and stay lean is to produce lean managers,” says Womack. “Every isolated effort will recede—or fail—unless companies learn to use the lean process as a way of developing individual problem-solvers with the ownership, initiative, and know-how to solve problems, learn, and ultimately coach new individuals in this discipline. That’s why this book matters so much.” The Lean Manager, the sequel to the Ballé’s international bestselling business novel The Gold Mine, tells the compelling story of plant manager Andrew Ward as he goes through the challenging but rewarding journey to becoming a lean manager. Under the guidance of Phil Jenkinson (whose own lean journey was at the core of The Gold Mine), Ward learns to use a deep understanding of lean tools, as well as a technical know-how of his plant’s operations, to foster a lean attitude that sustains continuous improvement. Where The Gold Mine shows you how to introduce a complete lean system, The Lean Manager demonstrates how to sustain it. Ward moves beyond fluency with tools to changing his behavior as a manager and leader. He shifts from giving orders and answers to asking the right questions so people identify and address problems. He learns how to use tools to unleash the creativity and motivation of people, so they learn how to solve problems as well as coach and teach others to solve problems. Ward learns how to create lean managers. “I am excited and have hopes that this book will enlighten readers about what it really means to live a business transformation that puts customers first and does this through developing people,” said Jeffrey Liker, author of The Toyota Way and professor of Industrial and Operations Engineering at the University of Michigan. “People who do the work have to improve the work. There are tools, but they are not tools for ‘improving the process.’ They are tools for making problems visible and for helping people think about how to solve those problems.”', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6yZuUQl4F24C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2011-09-15', false);

While there is widespread adoption of TPS, there is still much to be learned about its fundamental principles. This unique volume delivers a clear, concise overview of the Toyota Production System and kaizen in the very words of the architect of both of these movements, Taiicho Ohno, published to mark what would have been his 100th birthday. Filled with insightful new commentary from global quality visionaries, Taiichi Ohno’s Workplace Management is a classic that shows how Toyota managers were taught to think. Based on a series of interviews with Ohno himself, this timeless work is a tribute to his genius and to the core values that have made, and continue to make, Toyota one of the most successful manufacturers in the world. "Whatever name you may give our system, there are parts of it that are so far removed from generally accepted ideas (common sense) that if you do it only half way, it can actually make things worse." "If you are going to do TPS you must do it all the way. You also need to change the way you think. You need to change how you look at things." -- Taiichi Ohno "This book brings to us Taiichi Ohno''s philosophy of workplace management--the thinking behind the Toyota Production System. I personally get a thrill down my spine to read these thoughts in Ohno’s own words." -- Dr. Jeffrey Liker, Director, Japan Technology Management Program, University of Michigan, and Author, The Toyota Way Based on a series of interviews with Taiicho Ohno, this unique volume delivers a clear, concise overview of the Toyota Production System and kaizen in the very words of the architect of both of these movements, published to mark what would have been his 100th birthday.

Specifications were finalized on March 15, 1940; the airfoil prototype was complete on September 9; and the aircraft made its maiden flight on October 26. Now that is a lean development process!" —Allen Ward and Durward Sobek, commenting on the development of the P-51 Mustang and its exemplary use of trade-off curves. Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award recipient, 2008 Despite attempts to interpret and apply lean product development techniques, companies still struggle with design quality problems, long lead times, and high development costs. To be successful, lean product development must go beyond techniques, technologies, conventional concurrent engineering methods, standardized engineering work, and heavyweight project managers. Allen Ward showed the way. In a truly groundbreaking first edition of Lean Product and Process Development, Ward delivered -- with passion and penetrating insights that cannot be found elsewhere -- a comprehensive view of lean principles for developing and sustaining product and process development. In the second edition, Durward Sobek, professor of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at Montana State University—and one of Ward’s premier students—edits and reorganizes the original text to make it more accessible and actionable. This new edition builds on the first one by: Adding five in-depth and inspiring case studies. Including insightful new examples and illustrations. Updating concepts and tools based on recent developments in product development. Expanding the discussion around the critical concept of set-based concurrent engineering. Adding a more detailed table of contents and an index to make the book more accessible and user-friendly. The True Purpose of Product Development Ward’s core thesis is that the very aim of the product development process is to create profitable operational value streams, and that the key to doing so predictably, efficiently, and effectively is to create useable knowledge. Creating useable knowledge requires learning, so Ward also creates a basic learning model for development. But Ward not only describes the technical tools needed to make lean product and process development actually work. He also delineates the management system, management behaviors, and mental models needed. In this breakthrough text, Ward: Asks fundamental questions about the purpose and “value added” in product development so you gain a crystal clear understanding of essential issues. Shows you how to find the most common forms of “knowledge waste” that plagues product development. Identifies four “cornerstones” of lean product development gleaned from the practices of successful companies like Toyota and its partners, and explains how they differ from conventional practices. Gives you specific, practical recommendations for establishing your own lean development processes. Melds observations of effective teamwork from his military background, engineering fundamentals from his education and personal experience, design methodology from his research, and theories about management and learning from his study of history and experiences with customers. Changes your thinking forever about product development.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Zm7tAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2014-03-05', false);

Jego wykłady i seminaria, które prowadził po II Wojnie Światowej w Japonii, stały się bezpośrednim przyczynkiem do podniesienia konkurencyjności przemysłu japońskiego i jego ekspansji na całym świecie. Japończycy wzięli sobie do serca przesłanie Deminga i zaczęli stosować jego nauki, czego skutki widzimy do dzisiaj. Japonia stała się potęgą gospodarczą, a jej przedsiębiorstwa awansowały do światowej ligi.Niniejsza książka jest odpowiedzią autora na to, co działo się w przemyśle amerykańskim po II Wojnie Światowej. Podczas gdy Japończycy doskonalili swoje procesy i systemy, Amerykanie skupiali się wyłącznie na wynikach. Zarządzanie w oderwaniu od procesów, operowanie wyłącznie liczbami, bez pełnego zrozumienia kontekstu ichpowstawania i brak zrozumienia zmienności doprowadziły, w ocenie Deminga, do kryzysu zarządzania, który w rezultacie spowoduje kryzys ekonomiczny.

Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. This groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours— sometimes even minutes–no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base. Jez Humble and David Farley begin by presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-risk delivery process. Next, they introduce the “deployment pipeline,” an automated process for managing all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the “ecosystem” needed to support continuous delivery, from infrastructure, data and configuration management to governance. The authors introduce state-of-the-art techniques, including automated infrastructure management and data migration, and the use of virtualization. For each, they review key issues, identify best practices, and demonstrate how to mitigate risks. Coverage includes • Automating all facets of building, integrating, testing, and deploying software • Implementing deployment pipelines at team and organizational levels • Improving collaboration between developers, testers, and operations • Developing features incrementally on large and distributed teams • Implementing an effective configuration management strategy • Automating acceptance testing, from analysis to implementation • Testing capacity and other non-functional requirements • Implementing continuous deployment and zero-downtime releases • Managing infrastructure, data, components and dependencies • Navigating risk management, compliance, and auditing Whether you’re a developer, systems administrator, tester, or manager, this book will help your organization move from idea to release faster than ever—so you can deliver value to your business rapidly and reliably.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6ADDuzere-YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2010-07-27', false);

The same content from The Chicago Manual of Style is in both versions. In the 1890s, a proofreader at the University of Chicago Press prepared a single sheet of typographic fundamentals intended as a guide for the University community. That sheet grew into a pamphlet, and the pamphlet grew into a book—the first edition of the Manual of Style, published in 1906. Now in its fifteenth edition, The Chicago Manual of Style—the essential reference for authors, editors, proofreaders, indexers, copywriters, designers, and publishers in any field—is more comprehensive and easier to use than ever before. Those who work with words know how dramatically publishing has changed in the past decade, with technology now informing and influencing every stage of the writing and publishing process. In creating the fifteenth edition of the Manual, Chicago''s renowned editorial staff drew on direct experience of these changes, as well as on the recommendations of the Manual''s first advisory board, composed of a distinguished group of scholars, authors, and professionals from a wide range of publishing and business environments. Every aspect of coverage has been examined and brought up to date—from publishing formats to editorial style and method, from documentation of electronic sources to book design and production, and everything in between. In addition to books, the Manual now also treats journals and electronic publications. All chapters are written for the electronic age, with advice on how to prepare and edit manuscripts online, handle copyright and permissions issues raised by technology, use new methods of preparing mathematical copy, and cite electronic and online sources. A new chapter covers American English grammar and usage, outlining the grammatical structure of English, showing how to put words and phrases together to achieve clarity, and identifying common errors. The two chapters on documentation have been reorganized and updated: the first now describes the two main systems preferred by Chicago, and the second discusses specific elements and subject matter, with examples of both systems. Coverage of design and manufacturing has been streamlined to reflect what writers and editors need to know about current procedures. And, to make it easier to search for information, each numbered paragraph throughout the Manual is now introduced by a descriptive heading. Clear, concise, and replete with commonsense advice, The Chicago Manual of Style, fifteenth edition, offers the wisdom of a hundred years of editorial practice while including a wealth of new topics and updated perspectives. For anyone who works with words, whether on a page or computer screen, this continues to be the one reference book you simply must have. What''s new in the Fifteenth Edition: * Updated material throughout to reflect current style, technology, and professional practice * Scope expanded to include journals and electronic publications * Comprehensive new chapter on American English grammar and usage by Bryan A.

However, for the designer who wants to implement these codes, at first sight they appear to be a nightmare. We came a huge step closer in striving the theoretical limit, but see the historical axiom repeated on a different scale: we know we can achieve excellent performance with turbo codes, but not how to realize this in real devices.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UZjbBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2012-12-06', false);

The operating power of base stations is a significant cost for operators, and is currently optimized using state-of-the-art hardware solutions, such as heterogeneous distributed systems. The traditional system design method of porting algorithms to heterogeneous distributed systems based on test-and-refine methods is a manual, thus time-expensive, task. Physical Layer Multi-Core Prototyping: A Dataflow-Based Approach provides a clear introduction to the 3GPP LTE physical layer and to dataflow-based prototyping and programming. The difficulties in the process of 3GPP LTE physical layer porting are outlined, with particular focus on automatic partitioning and scheduling, load balancing and computation latency reduction, specifically in systems based on heterogeneous multi-core Digital Signal Processors. Multi-core prototyping methods based on algorithm dataflow modeling and architecture system-level modeling are assessed with the goal of automating and optimizing algorithm porting. With its analysis of physical layer processing and proposals of parallel programming methods, which include automatic partitioning and scheduling, Physical Layer Multi-Core Prototyping: A Dataflow-Based Approach is a key resource for researchers and students.

For all things 5G, this book is a must-read. Signal processing techniques have played the most important role in wireless communications since the second generation of cellular systems. It is anticipated that new techniques employed in 5G wireless networks will not only improve peak service rates significantly, but also enhance capacity, coverage, reliability , low-latency, efficiency, flexibility, compatibility and convergence to meet the increasing demands imposed by applications such as big data, cloud service, machine-to-machine (M2M) and mission-critical communications. This book is a comprehensive and detailed guide to all signal processing techniques employed in 5G wireless networks. Uniquely organized into four categories, New Modulation and Coding, New Spatial Processing, New Spectrum Opportunities and New System-level Enabling Technologies, it covers everything from network architecture, physical-layer (down-link and up-link), protocols and air interface, to cell acquisition, scheduling and rate adaption, access procedures and relaying to spectrum allocations. All technology aspects and major roadmaps of global 5G standard development and deployments are included in the book. Key Features: Offers step-by-step guidance on bringing 5G technology into practice, by applying algorithms and design methodology to real-time circuit implementation, taking into account rapidly growing applications that have multi-standards and multi-systems. Addresses spatial signal processing for 5G, in particular massive multiple-input multiple-output (massive-MIMO), FD-MIMO and 3D-MIMO along with orbital angular momentum multiplexing, 3D beamforming and diversity. Provides detailed algorithms and implementations, and compares all multicarrier modulation and multiple access schemes that offer superior data transmission performance including FBMC, GFDM, F-OFDM, UFMC, SEFDM, FTN, MUSA, SCMA and NOMA. Demonstrates the translation of signal processing theories into practical solutions for new spectrum opportunities in terms of millimeter wave, full-duplex transmission and license assisted access. Presents well-designed implementation examples, from individual function block to system level for effective and accurate learning. Covers signal processing aspects of emerging system and network architectures, including ultra-dense networks (UDN), software-defined networks (SDN), device-to-device (D2D) communications and cloud radio access network (C-RAN).', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CJ7LDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2016-10-17', false);

Many of them have gone through some motions regarding requirements as if they were sleepworking. It''s time to wake up and do it right-and this book is going to be their alarm clock." -Jerry Weinberg, author of numerous books on productivity enhancement "In today''s complex, fast-paced software development environment, collaboration-the intense peer-to-peer conversations that result in products, decisions, and knowledge sharing-is absolutely essential to success. But all too often, attempts to collaborate degenerate into agonizing meetings or ineffectual bull sessions. Ellen''s wonderful book will help you bridge the gap-turning the agony of meetings into the ecstasy of effective collaboration." -Jim Highsmith, a pioneer in adaptive software development methods "Requirements by Collaboration presents a wealth of practical tools and techniques for facilitating requirements development workshops. It is suitable-no, essential reading-for requirements workshop facilitators. It will help both technical people and customer representatives participate in these critical contributions to software success." -Karl Wiegers, Principal Consultant, Process Impact, author of Software Requirements "The need for this particular book, at this particular time, is crystal clear. We have entered a new age where software development must be viewed as a form of business problem solving. That means direct user participation in developing ''requirements,'' or more accurately, in jointly working the business problem. That, in turn, means facilitated sessions. In this book, Ellen Gottesdiener provides a wealth of practical ideas for ensuring that you have exactly the right stuff for this all-important area of professional art." -Ronald G. Ross, Principal, Business Rule Solutions, LLC, Executive Editor, www.BRCommunity.com "Gottesdiener''s years of software development experience coupled with her straight-forward writing style make her book a perfect choice for either a senior developer or a midlevel project manager. In addition to her technical experience, her knowledge of group dynamics balance the book by educating the reader on how to manage conflict and personality differences within a requirements team-something that is missing from most requirements textbooks...It is a required ''handbook'' that will be referred to again and again." -Kay Christian, ebusiness Consultant, Conifer, Colorado "Requirements by Collaboration is a ''must read'' for any system stakeholder. End users and system analysts will learn the significant value they can add to the systems development process. Management will learn the tremendous return they may receive from making a modest time/people investment in facilitated sessions. Facilitators will discover ways to glean an amazing amount of high-quality information in a relatively brief time." -Russ Schwartz, Computer System Quality Consultant, Global Biotechnology Firm "In addition to showing how requirements are identified, evaluated, and confirmed, Ellen provides important guidance based on her own real-world experience for creating and managing the workshop environment in which requirements are generated. This book is an engaging and invaluable resource for project teams and sponsors, both business and IT, who are committed to achieving results in the most productive manner possible." -Hal Thilmony, Senior Manager, Business Process Improvement (Finance), CiscoSystems, Inc. "Project managers should read this book for assistance with planning the requirements process. Experienced facilitators will enrich their knowledge. New facilitators can use this book to get them up to speed and become more effective in less time." -Rob Stroober, Competence Development Manager and Project Manager, Deloitte &Touche Consultdata, The Netherlands "While many books discuss the details of software requirement artifacts (for example, use cases), Ellen''s new book zeros in on effective workshop techniques and tools used to gather the content of these artifacts. As a pioneer in requirements workshops, she shares her real-life experiences in a comprehensive and easy-to-read book with many helpful examples and diagrams." -Bill Bird, Aera Energy LLC "Requirements by Collaboration is absolutely full of guidance on the most effective ways to use workshops in requirements capture. This book will help workshop owners and facilitators to determine and gain agreement on a sound set of requirements, which will form a solid foundation for the development work that is to follow." -Jennifer Stapleton, Software Process Consultant and author of DSDM: The Methodin Practice "This book provides an array of techniques within a clear, structured process, along with excellent examples of how and when to use them. It''s an excellent, practical, and really useful handbook written by a very experienced author!" -Jean-Anne Kirk, Director DSDM Consortium and IAF Professional Development "Ellen has written a detailed, comprehensive, and practical handbook for facilitating groups in gathering requirements. The processes she outlines give the facilitator tools to bring together very different perspectives from stakeholders elegantly and with practical, useable results." -Jo Nelson, Principal, ICA Associates, Inc., Chair, IAF (2001-2002) Requirements by Collaboration: Workshops for Defining Needs focuses on the human side of software development--how well we work with our customers and teammates. Experience shows that the quality and degree of participation, communication, respect, and trust among all the stakeholders in a project can strongly influence its success or failure. Ellen Gottesdiener points out that such qualities are especially important when defining user requirements and she shows in this book exactly what to do about that fact. Gottesdiener shows specifically how to plan and conduct requirements workshops. These carefully organized and facilitated meetings bring business managers, technical staff, customers, and users into a setting where, together, they can discover, evolve, validate, verify, and agree upon their product needs. Not only are their requirements more effectively defined through this collaboration, but the foundation is laid for good teamwork throughout the entire project. Other books focus on how to build the product right. Requirements by Collaboration focuses instead on what must come first--the right product to build.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3ktWZK5i8CwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2015-01-01', false);

In this innovative book, Professor Robert Harper offers a fresh perspective on the fundamentals of these languages through the use of type theory. Whereas most textbooks on the subject emphasize taxonomy, Harper instead emphasizes genetics, examining the building blocks from which all programming languages are constructed. Language features are manifestations of type structure. The syntax of a language is governed by the constructs that define its types, and its semantics is determined by the interactions among those constructs. The soundness of a language design – the absence of ill-defined programs – follows naturally. Professor Harper''s presentation is simultaneously rigorous and intuitive, relying on elementary mathematics. The framework he outlines scales easily to a rich variety of language concepts and is directly applicable to their implementation. The result is a lucid introduction to programming theory that is both accessible and practical.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9sshAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2012-12-17', false);

Information technology can and should deliver business value. But the Agile literature has paid scant attention to what business value means—and how to know whether or not you are delivering it. This problem becomes ever more critical as you push value delivery toward autonomous teams and away from requirements “tossed over the wall” by business stakeholders. An empowered team needs to understand its goal! Playful and thought-provoking, The Art of Business Value explores what business value means, why it matters, and how it should affect your software development and delivery practices. More than any other IT delivery approach, DevOps (and Agile thinking in general) makes business value a central concern. This book examines the role of business value in software and makes a compelling case for why a clear understanding of business value will change the way you deliver software. This book will make you think deeply about not only what it means to deliver value but also the relationship of the IT organization to the rest of the enterprise. It will give you the language to discuss value with the business, methods to cut through bureaucracy and strategies for incorporating Agile teams and culture into the enterprise. Most of all, this book will startle you into new ways of thinking about the cutting-edge of Agile practice and where it may lead."', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gykhDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2016-04-07', false);

How do we sustain momentum?" They know that companies and organizations cannot thrive today without learning to adapt their attitudes and practices. But companies that establish change initiatives discover, after initial success, that even the most promising efforts to transform or revitalize organizations—despite interest, resources, and compelling business results—can fail to sustain themselves over time. That''s because organizations have complex, well-developed immune systems, aimed at preserving the status quo. Now, drawing upon new theories about leadership and the long-term success of change initiatives, and based upon twenty-five years of experience building learning organizations, the authors of The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook show how to accelerate success and avoid the obstacles that can stall momentum. The Dance of Change, written for managers and executives at every level of an organization, reveals how business leaders can work together to anticipate the challenges that profound change will ultimately force the organization to face. Then, in a down-to-earth and compellingly clear format, readers will learn how to build the personal and organizational capabilities needed to meet those challenges. These challenges are not imposed from the outside; they are the product of assumptions and practices that people take for granted—an inherent, natural part of the processes of change. And they can stop innovation cold, unless managers at all levels learn to anticipate them and recognize the hidden rewards in each challenge, and the potential to spur further growth. Within the frequently encountered challenge of "Not Enough Time," for example—the lack of control over time available for innovation and learning initiatives—lies a valuable opportunity to reframe the way people organize their workplaces. This book identifies universal challenges that organizations ultimately find themselves confronting, including the challenge of "Fear and Anxiety"; the need to diffuse learning across organizational boundaries; the ways in which assumptions built in to corporate measurement systems can handcuff learning initiatives; and the almost unavoidable misunderstandings between "true believers" and nonbelievers in a company. Filled with individual and team exercises, in-depth accounts of sustaining learning initiatives by managers and leaders in the field, and well-tested practical advice, The Dance of Change provides an insider''s perspective on implementing learning and change initiatives at such corporations as British Petroleum, Chrysler, Dupont, Ford, General Electric, Harley-Davidson, Hewlett-Packard, Mitsubishi Electric, Royal DutchShell, Shell Oil Company, Toyota, the United States Army, and Xerox. It offers crucial advice for line-level managers, executive leaders, internal networkers, educators, and others who are struggling to put change initiatives into practice.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QjBkAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2014-05-14', false);

Wolne Lektury to biblioteka internetowa, rozwijana pod patronatem Ministerstwa Edukacji Narodowej. W jej zbiorach znajduje się kilka tysięcy utworów, w tym wiele lektur szkolnych zalecanych do użytku przez MEN, które trafiły już do domeny publicznej. Wszystkie dzieła są odpowiednio opracowane opatrzone przypisami oraz motywami. Charles Baudelaire Ur. 9 kwietnia 1821 r. w Paryżu Zm. 31 sierpnia 1867 r. w Paryżu Najważniejsze dzieła (zbiory wierszy) Kwiaty zła (1857), Sztuczne raje (1860), Paryski spleen (1864); (zbiory pism estetycznych) Salon 1845, Salon 1846, Malarz życia nowoczesnego (1863), Sztuka romantyczna (1868); Moje obnażone serce (1897) Francuski poeta i krytyk sztuki, jedna z najbardziej wpływowych postaci literatury XIX w. Zaliczany do grona tzw. ,,poetów przeklętych". Ostatni romantyk (wyprowadził własne wnioski z wielowątkowego dorobku tej epoki), był jednocześnie zwolennikiem metody realistycznej w literaturze. Bliskie sobie tematy i idee odnajdowali w jego twórczości parnasiści (sztuka dla sztuki, piękno nie jest użyteczne), wyznawcy dekadentyzmu (ból istnienia), symboliści, surrealiści czy przedstawiciele modernizmu katolickiego; w jego dorobku za równie istotne jak utwory własne uważa się przekłady wierszy Edgara Allana Poego. W 1841odbył podróż morską odwiedzając wyspy Mauritius i Reunion oraz (być może) Indie, co jako doświadczenie egzotyki wpłynęło na jego wyobraźnię poetycką. Od 1842 r. przez dwadzieścia lat był związany z półFrancuską, półAfrykanką urodzoną na Haiti Jeanne Duval, aktorką i tancerką, której poświęcił wiele ze swoich najsłynniejszych wierszy (m.in. Padlina, Do Kreolki, Sed non satiata, Zapach egzotyczny, Tańcząca żmija). Jej portret w półleżącej pozie stworzył w 1862 r. Manet. Pierwsze publikacje Baudelaire''a dotyczyły malarstwa (zbiory Salon 1845 i Salon 1846) i również później zajmował się on krytyką sztuk plastycznych (w 1855r. wydał kolejny tom szkiców), a jego artykuły poświęcone Delacroix, Ingresowi czy Manetowi (Malarz życia współczesnego) należą do kanonicznych tekstów teoretycznych o sztuce. Choć nie zajmował się muzyką, był pierwszym, który docenił dzieło Wagnera. W 1848 r. Baudelaire włączył się aktywnie w rewolucję Wiosny Ludów o epizodzie tym zadecydowały nie tyle poglądy polityczne, ile poryw ducha i osobista niechęć do ojczyma, Jacques''a Aupicka, generała armii francuskiej. Nie najlepiej czuł się w rzeczywistości ustanowionego po upadku rewolty burżuazyjnokonserwatywnego ładu II Cesarstwa; niemal jako osobistą tragedię przeżył zarządzoną przez Napoleona III przebudowę Paryża, w wyniku której wyburzono wiele ze starej, średniowiecznej zabudowy miasta. Z powodu wydanego w 1857 r. tomu poezji Kwiaty zła autor został oskarżony o obrazę moralności, skazany na grzywnę i zmuszony do usunięcia niektórych utworów (pełne wydanie ukazało się dopiero w 1913 r.). Baudelaire obracał się w kręgu najwybitniejszych twórców epoki, takich jak Balzac, Nerval, Flaubert czy Gautier. Zostawił też wiele artykułów (pisanych często na zamówienie do gazet) o współczesnych mu twórcach literatury oraz żywych portretów kolegów po piórze w pamiętnikach Moje serce obnażone czy wydanych pośmiertnie Dziennikach poufnych. Przy tej okazji formułował swój własny system filozoficznoestetyczny. Pierwsze, powierzchowne wrażenie każe uznać, że Baudelaire epatuje obrazami wszystkiego, co budzi obrzydzenie oraz śmiałą erotyką. Jednak nie zajmował się on obrazoburstwem dla niego samego, ale uznając, że świat jest słownikiem hieroglifów, uważał, że należy dostrzec i zinterpretować wszelkie przejawy rzeczywistości, co pozwoli dosięgnąć piękna będącego absolutem istniejącego poza światem; jego teoria estetyczna naznaczona była mistycyzmem w duchu Swedenborga i platońskim idealizmem. Pierwszy tom jego wierszy charakteryzuje klasyczna forma, w którą wlana została nie poruszana dotąd tematyka, natomiast Paryski spleen jako zbiór poematów prozą stanowi krok w kierunku poezji nowoczesnej. Powszechnie uważa się, że Baudelaire zmarł na syfilis, podobnie jak jego wieloletnia kochanka, był też uzależniony od laudanum i przypuszczalnie od opium, nadużywał alkoholu, przez lata pędził życie kloszarda. W 1866 r. podczas pobytu w Belgii doznał wylewu krwi do mózgu i został częściowo sparaliżowany. Rok później zmarł w klinice w Paryżu i został pochowany na cmentarzu Montparnasse. Wydaniem pozostałych po nim pism zajęła się owdowiała powtórnie matka.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=77gRBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2012-09-21', false);

Dobrym potwierdzeniem jego słów jest tocząca się od pół wieku dyskusja wokół pojęcia światów możliwych. Poniżej przyjrzymy się pokrótce temu, skąd takie zainteresowanie tym pojęciem wśród filozofów. Czym mogą być światy możliwe? > Tadeusz Ciecierski Co takiego mamy na myśli, gdy stwierdzamy, że Bernie Sanders wygrałby wybory, gdyby był oficjalnym kandydatem demokratów? Jedna z popularnych w filozofii sugestii głosi, że mamy wtedy na myśli to, iż w każdym odpowiednio podobnym do naszego świecie możliwym, w którym partia demokratyczna wystawia Sandersa, ten wygrywa wybory. Czym jednak są te tajemnicze światy możliwe, na które się tu powołujemy? Do czego służy pojęcie światów możliwych? – infografika Kot Schrödingera > Jakub Jernajczyk Fizyka kwantowa ma charakter probabilistyczny. Wedle jej kopenhaskiej interpretacji przed dokonaniem pomiaru układ kwantowy znajduje się w tzw. stanie mieszanym – przyjmuje wszystkie możliwe stany opisywane przez funkcję falową Schrödingera. Dopiero akt obserwacji niejako zmusza układ kwantowy do przyjęcia konkretnego stanu (w wyniku załamania funkcji falowej). Z wizytą w (możliwym) świecie zombi > Jacek Jarocki Filozofia analityczna miała być w założeniu wzorowana na metodach nauk ścisłych, takich jak fizyka czy chemia. Jednakże filozof – w przeciwieństwie do swoich kolegów naukowców – nie dysponuje klasycznym laboratorium. Odpowiednikiem przestrzeni do badań bywa jednak jego wyobraźnia, zamieszkiwana przez różne stwory: bagnoludy, neurolożki-daltonistki oraz zombi. Czy możliwy jest świat bez Boga? > Dariusz Łukasiewicz Czy pojęcie świata możliwego może być użyteczne dla ateisty w dyskusjach nad tezą o istnieniu Boga? Moim zdaniem może być użyteczne w precyzowaniu pojęcia ateizmu i rozróżnianiu jego odmian. Przechwałka króla Alfonsa > Nicholas Rescher Król Alfons X (1221–1284), zwany „Mądrym” (El Sabio), który w połowie trzynastego wieku rządził Kastylią (jak i wieloma innymi krainami), był uczonym z prawdziwego zdarzenia. Studiując astronomiczny system Ptolemeusza, postulujący liczne cykle i epicykle, miał powiedzieć: „Gdyby Bóg Wszechmogący, zanim zabrał się za stworzenie, zapytał mnie o zdanie, zaproponowałbym coś znacznie prostszego”.

Matrix – komiks filozoficzny Filozofia z przymrużeniem oka Redaktor prowadzący numeru: Artur Gerard Kosecki. Drodzy Czytelnicy, drugi rok wydawania magazynu wieńczymy numerem o światach możliwych. Gdy ogłaszaliśmy ankietę dla Czytelników z dwunastoma tematami do wyboru, świat, w którym wydajemy ostatni w tym roku numer magazynu o światach możliwych, był jednym ze światów możliwych. Gdy zamknęliśmy ankietę, „uczynił on” duży krok w kierunku bycia światem aktualnym, zrealizowanym, faktycznym. Wówczas nadal mógł się zrealizować na wiele sposobów – mieliśmy bowiem wiele pomysłów i wyobrażeń, jak ten numer miałby wyglądać. Ostatecznie zrealizowała się jedna z tych możliwych wersji – ta, którą czytacie. Alternatywne wersje dwunastego numeru „Filozofuj!” pozostały w dziedzinie światów możliwych. Wśród tych światów znajdziemy nie tylko podjęte tematy numerów naszego czasopisma, ale całą plejadę możliwości: wojny, których nie było; miłości, które się nigdy nie zdarzyły; książki, które nie zostały napisane – to tylko kilka wybranych na chybił trafił przypadków. Obok tych „normalnych” alternatyw istnieją także możliwości bardziej fantastyczne: Śródziemie, szkoła w Hogwarcie czy świat „Gwiezdnych wojen”. Światy możliwe oraz sam fakt, że potrafimy o nich myśleć, odwiedzać je w wyobraźni, są niezwykle intrygujące. Przecież faktycznie, przynajmniej w naszej rzeczywistości, te światy nie istnieją. A jednak w jakimś sensie są one od naszej myśli niezależne. Bywa, że są przedmiotem naszych autentycznych emocji, dyskusji. Często orzekamy o nich jak o realnych obiektach. Na przykład na pytanie, czy to prawda, że Gandalf Szary jest czarodziejem, wielu z Was bez wahania pokiwałoby twierdząco głowami. Wielu szczerze roniło łzy, myśląc, że zginął on w czeluściach Morii. Podobnie wielu z dużym przekonaniem mogłoby rozprawiać o tym, czy rzucanie czarów przez Harry’ego Pottera bez użycia różdżki jest możliwe. Idea światów możliwych generuje liczne pytania filozoficzne. Na przykład, gdzie znajduje się Śródziemie? Gdzie jest Hogwart? Czy są to może jakieś realne miejsca bytujące w równoległych światach, względem których nasza rzeczywistość zdaje się jedynie czystą możliwością? Czy też raczej są to jedynie światy wyobrażone, bytujące jedynie w naszych umysłach? Czy można mówić o różnych rodzajach możliwości? Na przykład czy możliwość rzucania czarów jest równie możliwa co możliwość wygrania na loterii? Czy 2 plus 2 zawsze musi równać się 4? Czy wszystko jest możliwe? A może też istnieją niemożliwe przedmioty? Istnieją? Jak mogą istnieć przedmioty niemożliwe? Problematyczne, jak widać, jest samo pojęcie istnienia (chociaż ten temat pozostawmy na inną okazję). Dla filozofów światy możliwe to nie tylko intrygująca zagadka filozoficzna, ale także użyteczne narzędzie filozofowania. Kreując fantastyczne eksperymenty myślowe, światy pełne zombich, XYZ zamiast wody czy politycznych utopii filozofowie, testują swoje intuicje dotyczące różnych pojęć, tez i teorii. Świadomi wagi światów możliwych dla filozofii, chcemy Was zaprosić do filozoficznej refleksji nad tymi intrygującymi bytami-niebytami. Oferujemy wam teksty autorów specjalizujących się w tematyce światów możliwych, w których zastanawiają się oni nad tym, czym właściwie światy możliwe są, dlaczego są one tak ważne dla filozofii, czemu służą. Oprócz artykułów tematycznych znajdziecie także nasze stałe propozycje: dalsze części kursu logiki, sztuki argumentacji, „who is who” w polskiej filozofii, wywiad z wielkim filozofem z przeszłości (tym razem jest to Gottfried Leibniz), kolejną część rozważań o problemach moralnych w literaturze, nowy eksperyment filozoficzny. Czeka na Was także odrobina filozoficznej rozrywki: kolejna satyra filozoficzna z krainy Kalopów, anegdoty, komiks, filozoficzne zoo czy krzyżówka. Życzymy Wam, by w nadchodzącym roku zrealizował się najlepszy z możliwych scenariuszy Waszego życia. Mamy nadzieję, że będzie to scenariusz, w którym będzie też czas na lekturę naszego magazynu.

Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. This groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours— sometimes even minutes–no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base. Jez Humble and David Farley begin by presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-risk delivery process. Next, they introduce the “deployment pipeline,” an automated process for managing all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the “ecosystem” needed to support continuous delivery, from infrastructure, data and configuration management to governance. The authors introduce state-of-the-art techniques, including automated infrastructure management and data migration, and the use of virtualization. For each, they review key issues, identify best practices, and demonstrate how to mitigate risks. Coverage includes • Automating all facets of building, integrating, testing, and deploying software • Implementing deployment pipelines at team and organizational levels • Improving collaboration between developers, testers, and operations • Developing features incrementally on large and distributed teams • Implementing an effective configuration management strategy • Automating acceptance testing, from analysis to implementation • Testing capacity and other non-functional requirements • Implementing continuous deployment and zero-downtime releases • Managing infrastructure, data, components and dependencies • Navigating risk management, compliance, and auditing Whether you’re a developer, systems administrator, tester, or manager, this book will help your organization move from idea to release faster than ever—so you can deliver value to your business rapidly and reliably.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6ADDuzere-YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', '2010-07-27', false);
